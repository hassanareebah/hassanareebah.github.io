Skype,2024-09-19,N/A,"I've cancelled my monthly subscription in their website two months ago, and they continue with the automatic debit.Also, I've sent 2 (two) emails for this matter, with NO answer. An email yesterday, and another one month ago.DO NOT TRUST IN SKYPE. THIS COMPANY DESERVE TO GO BANKRUPT."
Skype,2024-09-10,1,Skype is the worst telephone service that I've ever used. Microsoft has cut corners by hiring only those with an IQ less than 50 so they're not only unable to provide service --even when you are paying for it--they're barely able to communicate. I am very sympathetic towards the simple but even if Microsoft is only paying meger salaries they are losing because they are unable to hire capable employees who can function. This is been going on for months. Trust pilot only provides space for one date of incompetent experience.
Skype,2024-09-12,1,"You have to purchase different credits for different types of use e.g. domestic international. Take a lifetime.e for the credit to be applied, so you can't use it at the ti.e of purchase.Avoid, use other service providers who ate cheaper and easier to use."
Skype,2024-09-14,N/A,On mobile totally slow speed.. very bad experience on mobile...On desktop also too much issues...like video clip is slow processing..
Skype,2024-09-17,N/A,"They advertise a price of less than 2p per minute, but then charged me 6p for a 17 second phone call. And there seems to be no way to dispute this!"
Skype,2024-09-04,N/A,I have been using Skype for years and while it is not as streamlined as some other platforms I really can't complain. I have to use them for some business and the experience has never been terrible.
Skype,2024-08-14,2,"The phone app is one of the glitchiest out there. I'm paying for 3 services, yet the app OFTEN doesn't work. Unfortunately, tech support normally can't do much because it's the glitchy app--they just say to wait, sometimes several days. I guess it's no surprise--Microsoft doesn't seem to give a rat's rear about their users' experience with their products. I'm going to look for an alternative."
Skype,2024-08-16,1,"Worst unfriendly app ever.> very slow interface (example: when typing phone numbers as free digit is as slow as writing with a quill on an ancient scroll> unclear menus (completely unintuitive to find where the hell is the telephone keypad... which should be the first icon ever in a phone app!)> in iPhone, somehow is retrieving your phone book. but it’s totally messy, giving you back multiple lines with emails, addresses, nicknames etc. and u never find where the hell is the phone number to be called, so in the end u end up in filling it manually> contact list is totally messy. never understand what the order of the contact list is. if it’s by unread messages, or favorites (and not sure how the favorites are pre-classified), or by last call done...> alerts / notifications are not working at all on web and phone versions. For sure i missed all the time alerts for messages, not sure about the calls as i do not receive many on skype (thank God)"
Skype,2024-08-09,N/A,"Skype was charging me nearly $20/month for ""free"" service. They did not respond to repeated email requests to explain the large monthly charges so I canx the autopayments. Perhaps that will get their attention. We'll see."
Skype,2024-07-02,N/A,"I think Skype is one of those apps that is designed to hurt users. It's one of the hardest and most buggy applications I've ever encountered.

Skype,2023-10-23,1,"It used to be a really good app, but the moment it became a part of Microsoft everything went wrong. First the interface, which is unbearable, then weird policies like security policy which no-one can understand and lastly user management, where you never know if you are looking in your phone book and looking for a Skype user ...Relatively simple and easy task, isn't it? But Microsoft (again) made it totally wrong - like everything."
Skype,2023-02-07,1,This used to be a well functioning phone app that was a reasonably priced alternative worldwide when other phone services failed.  Now it seems to be a Social Media wannabe that can't place a phone call. You can't even edit a contact entry. If MS wants to get into the Social Media game why didn't you just create an app instead of ruining this one?  Weren't apps your core business?
Skype,2024-04-29,1,I have found Skype good until you have a problem and loose your account. It is impossible to get any useful help on their chat line or through recover your account. Customer support is useless and you loose your credit. I have spent over eight hours trying to resolve this.
Skype,2024-08-19,N/A,"I have been a long-time user of Skype, but my recent experience has been incredibly frustrating and disappointing. I attempted to set up a UK caller ID using my UK mobile numbers (O2 UK and Vodafone UK) and was unable to receive the necessary verification codes. This issue persists despite successfully receiving codes for numbers from other countries.I have followed all the troubleshooting steps recommended by Microsoft Support, but nothing has worked. After reaching out to their support team multiple times, I received a single response acknowledging the issue, but since then, my follow-up emails have gone unanswered. I even requested to have the issue escalated or for a supervisor to step in, but that request was ignored as well.What’s worse is that this issue is causing significant disruption to my communication needs. I am now at a point where I may need to consider alternative solutions, as Skype no longer meets my needs effectively in the UK.I am extremely disappointed with the lack of support and responsiveness from Microsoft. If Skype cannot resolve this issue, it essentially makes their service unusable for UK users who need caller ID functionality. I would urge anyone considering Skype for UK communications to be aware of this problem and the poor customer support.Until this issue is resolved, I cannot recommend Skype for users in the UK. It’s frustrating to see such a basic functionality broken with no effort from the support team to provide a solution."

Skype,2024-03-19,2,Ik gebruik Skype al ruim 10 of 15 jaar. Ineens zijn 2 aankopen van $ 10 niet bijgeschreven. Het bleek dat op de email van mijn al bijna 2 jaar geleden overleden man de bedragen waren geaccepteerd en afgeschreven en later weer geweigerd. De betaling liep ineens via Google Play. Geen idee waarom het naar hem wordt gestuurd. Elke 2 a 3 maanden koop ik een beltegoed zonder enig probleem en nu ineens dit en ik zie geen mogelijkheid mijn geld terug te krijgen en ik ga natuurlijk niet voor een 3de keer beltegoed kopen. Einde Skype tijdperk. Jammer want ik kan mijn 95 jarige moeder in het buitenland  zonder internet niet meer bellen.

Skype,2024-02-11,1,I purchased an international call subscription on Skype and paid in app via Apple Pay. Apple took the payment but the subscription never came through. I’ve contacted both Apple and Skype multiple times about this and each point to the other as the responsible party. Apple refuses to refund the money and Skype refuses to activate the subscription as they say Apple has not sent through the required information. I have never had such a disappointing experience with an in-app purchase. This is outright fraud on the part of Skype.

No contacts are being added, no bulk messaging, no spam, and no scams are involved.Despite creating new accounts, you persistently ban me. Yesterday, I wasn't even using Skype when you blocked me again. You must stop relying on bots; Hire more humans; there's NO ONE to contact about the issue.The chat support is utterly USELESS, to say the least.

Skype,2023-08-24,N/A,"Skype’s annual revenues have fallen -74.5% since Microsoft’s 2011 $8.5 billion acquisition of Skype…Something’s obviously very wrong here.Microsoft has piled on ridiculously conspicuous Skype accounting practices, inconsistent billing, poor communication, connectivity (dropped calls on pickup, etc…), leading ultimately to client dissatisfaction, frustration, cancellations, churn, lost subs, lost revenue…(eg:) When required to replace / update your (dead) card on file, including annual subscriptions, MS won’t let you delete the original card, even after the charge, even after a replacement card has been posted; they’ll simply inform you, if you do so, they’ll cancel your subscription; all this due to their knowingly, creepy, buggy practices, software…Curiously, they allow stacked multiple cards, but MS will only bill the original card, which will eventually expire and/or is compromised, and fails; they won’t use the new card on file, exasperating annual subscriptions.Skype and SkypeIn are billed separately, in different locals, at differing times; no one could guide me to my SkypeIn pay details today… So, not only do you have to deal with Skype, SkypeIn, you submit payment through separate MS gateways, dealing with different portals, within MS… Again, a ridiculously ludicrously ineffectual interface, awful coding… Who’s actually in charge of creating this utter monstrosity, and why break something that wasn’t already broken…? How many more assets will MS endlessly pour into Skype; have they learned nothing from their past?Furthermore, instead of maintaining established payments through Skype, you’re redirected to a myriad of meaningless, confusing, non-navigational, non-intuitive MS interfaces, which resulted in an expired certificate.You’re only notified, less than a moments notice, your subscription has been CANCELLED, less than 48 hours prior to the subscription’s actual expiration, but within this timeframe, the account magically remains active, throwing users into a panicked state, even though a replacement card had already been on file, for almost 2 months prior, but MS elected not to use it; are they intentionally trying to sabotage themselves?As a legacy client, since Skype’s inception, I spent close to 6 hours, continuously as a MS hostage today, on their so-called chat support (no, you can’t speak with a human, only exhaustive chat text), as I was passed around like a rag doll, through ~10 different chat CSRs, as no one had the skill sets to resolve my matter, which they ultimately admitted they weren’t able to resolve, escalating upwards, meanwhile my Skype and SkypeIn will stop functioning until they fix the issue.This is a known issue which has been in existence since MS Skype acquisition, something which the FCC/SEC perhaps should investigate.How can a company of Microsoft’s stature, allow an acquired $8.5 billion asset, such as Skype, only to run it off the rails, with their ineffectual user interface, using MS proprietary coding, which doesn’t provide the same user interface experience, on their own or other platforms, including Android, iOS, etc… due in part to inconsistent proprietary coding, seemingly non existent debugging?One doesn’t have the same user interface on differing platforms; When chat support directs you to do something, that feature isn’t there… A very egregious waste of people’s personal time, and they’re simply unwilling to offer any compensation.Notifying them of their pitfalls leads absolutely nowhere… Nothing changes.- You can only stack crap so high before it collapses…MS has decided to add to Skype, Bing, AI and a myriad of other totally worthless unrelated, cluttered, nonessential communications features to the app, so much so, it’s now no longer Skype, while at the same time, I personally believe it has significantly increased the apps overhead, bogging down your device, decreasing security, increasing battery usage, all the while, constantly phishing your personal data... And all of this under a paid subscription banner…I didn’t sign up for any of this… Therefore I cannot recommend MS Skype in its present form.- - -*Skype was created by Niklas Zennström, Janus Friis, and four Estonian developers, first released in August 2003. In September 2005, eBay acquired Skype for $2.6 billion. In September 2009, Silver Lake, Andreessen Horowitz, and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board bought 65% of Skype for $1.9 billion from eBay, valuing the business at $2.92 billion. In May 2011, Microsoft bought Skype for $8.5 billion and used it to replace their Windows Live Messenger. As of 2011, most of the development team and 44% of all the division's employees were in Tallinn and Tartu, Estonia (*Wiki)."
Skype,2023-08-20,N/A,"Skype is a widely recognized telecommunications application that allows users to make voice and video calls, as well as send instant messages and files over the internet. While I don't have personal experiences, I can provide information up until September 2021.Skype was one of the pioneers in the realm of internet-based communication, offering free or low-cost voice and video calls to other Skype users around the world. It was known for its user-friendly interface, cross-platform compatibility, and the ability to connect with both individuals and groups. Skype also allowed users to make calls to traditional landlines and mobile phones for a fee, making it a versatile communication tool.One of Skype's standout features was its video call functionality, which played a significant role in keeping people connected across long distances. It was particularly useful for maintaining personal and professional relationships, especially when physical meetings were not possible.Skype also offered text messaging, file sharing, and screen sharing capabilities, enhancing its utility for collaboration and remote work. However, over time, competition from other platforms like WhatsApp, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet led to changes in the way people communicate digitally.In recent years, Microsoft, the parent company of Skype, has integrated some of Skype's functionalities into its other products, like Microsoft Teams. This has led to a shift in focus for Skype towards a more business-oriented audience.Despite its historical significance, Skype has seen a decline in usage compared to newer and more specialized communication tools. It remains a part of digital communication history as one of the first applications to truly popularize online video calling and instant messaging."

Skype,2023-08-16,N/A,I had a subscription to make unlimited calls to the US (landlines) for over 5 years and it worked perfectly until recently. The past few months I have been unable to connect to a US landline without any explanation or customer service help.

Skype,2023-08-07,1,Ridiculous situation my account was blocked right after registration. When I asked support about the problem the answer was that it was blocked because of ToS. They can not explain the reason.So Skype support suggests me create a new account with another email and card. It is ridiculous because if I use my card again the system will block my account again. So I have to go to a bank to issue a new card but it costs money. Skype what are you doing?
Skype,2023-08-05,N/A,"I have had a skype account for some 15 years and recently started to use it again after a long break. Within 2 days my account was locked for 'unusual activity'. After 3 lock outs it was blocked, I couldn't even get a code to reopen it. The unusual activity was down to skype allowing people I don't know to bombard me with messages, no matter how many times I block those people. They even managed to lock my account while I was not active on it for over a week. So much for staying in touch with friends and family. Utter rubbish."
Skype,2023-07-29,2,"The windows interface of Skype is a nightmare. Everytime I spend a few dozen seconds to find the dialpad.

Skype,2023-06-05,1,it is not hard to guess skype credit service is really rubbish.it is designed to get you off guards so they can get away with your money. when you think they do it to millions people around the world it quickly adds up in their bank account. i have not signed up for one year Subcription but they managed to put me in one year contract instead of one month contract. NEVER PAY THEM BY PAYPAL AGAIN USE BANK ACCOUNT AND MAKE ONE ONE OF MONTHLY PAYMENT ONLY.NEVER TRUST SKYPE CREDIT.ALWAYS KEEP AN EYE ON YOUR SKYPE CREDIT ACCOUNT. IF NOT NEXT THING YOU SEE THEY HAVE BEEN TAKING YOUR MONEY OUT OF YOUR ACCOUNT.INSTEAD OF £6 MONTHLY THEY TOOK OUT £ 61YEARLY.I CANCELED MY PAYPAL SKYPE PAYMENTS NOW BUT TOO LATE ALREADY.

Skype,2023-04-08,1,Wenn man mit Skype arbeitet kann man sich auch gleich erschießen. Das kommt dem Effekt von Skype sehr nah.Skype verstellt die Audioeinstellungen.Kontos werden gesperrt.Bezahlung ist total sinnlos.Unnötiges Programm das man schon nach der Installation von Windows wieder deinstalliert.Also wenn man unbedingt einen Sprachchat haben möchte rate ich zu Teamspeak3ist preiswert und funktioniert einwandfrei.

Skype,2023-03-24,1,Thought I paid for 1 month but they actually trick you and write in small print on email that they will charge you every month. Then they make it so hard where to find the cancel option. great job to MS thieves as per usual

Skype,2023-03-03,1,"I was on skype because the class I was enrolled in required me to be on a skype call. I never asked for an account, but I got charged a monthly fee of $2.99.

Skype,2023-02-07,1,This used to be a well functioning phone app that was a reasonably priced alternative worldwide when other phone services failed.  Now it seems to be a Social Media wannabe that can't place a phone call. You can't even edit a contact entry. If MS wants to get into the Social Media game why didn't you just create an app instead of ruining this one?  Weren't apps your core business?

Skype,2022-12-11,1,"I have been using Skype for over 30 years. Since I live in Norway. While my parents and sister live in Bulgaria. And have been very happy with Skype. Until Skype became part of Microsoft.My mother in Bulgaria got sick a few months ago. And she finds herself somewhere without a landline. Therefore she has to use only her old-fashioned mobile phone. Without internet and the option to download the APP is.Therefore, I would continue to use Skype to keep in touch with her. 3 months ago I extended my Skype subscription so that it will apply to mobile phones in addition to landlines. And I pay about €15 a month for this subscription.In addition to this subscription, I also have 60 minutes of free calls. Since I have an yearly Ofis subscription with Microsoft. But it doesn't help anything. Every time I call my mom, Skype tells me to pay and pay. Because Skype doesn't use the subscriptions I have. But instead I am charged for calls per minute, which is much more expensive.Today I tried to get help from Skype to solve this problem. Because I have felt cheated by this company. There was no help phone to be found. After many automatic questions and answers. Then I ended up on a page where they promised chat help. And I had to stand in a long line. I was number 66 in the line.It is not enough that you have to wait for them to help 66 people before me. But it said that you must not close this window. Because then you could get out of the line. In other words. You had to block your phone while waiting in line.And I waited, and waited, and waited. After about 2 hours I was number 1 in the line. Then I thought I would soon get the help I needed. But no. Another 2 hours passed while I was number 1 in the line. Without anything happening. Then I gave up.It seemed that people from Microsoft are speculating that if you choose to block your mobile to wait several hours for help. Most will give up. Since many people depend on using their mobiles for various tasks in everyday life.Many simple Norwegian companies that do not deal with software technology use software that give you the choice of being called or contacted back if there are long lines for help. But Microsoft probably don't have access to such ""complicated"" technology. Ha ha.  Maybe Mr. Bill Gates should try to fix the problems in his own company first. Before he throws himself into fixing the problems of the rest of humanity."

About two months ago Skype/Microsoft changed their payment methods web page, and after that for some reason they tried to take my regular monthly subscription with an old, expired credit card. Of course the bank did not allow this through. Because of this, my account is now restricted. Skype have details of my current credit cards in their systems, and indeed they take payments from these on a regular basis.But suddenly on 12 September, without informing me and for no reason, they tried to take a payment with an old expired card, which I used with them many years ago.In order to lift the restrictions on my account, Skype are asking for the first six digits and the last four digits of the expired card. Of course I no longer have this information - I cut the card up and threw it away many years ago - banks advise customers to do this.This is completely unreasonable - and I have spent hours of my time with customer agents at Skype explaining what I have written here. The customer agents are rude and unhelpful. This behaviour is utterly disgraceful - I am being penalised for Skype's error.

Skype,2022-10-08,N/A,Disaster. It was good in the past and an invaluable service but there must be technical issues and there is no sign of any technical support service or anywhere to report malfunctions. I eventually found one only to discover I had signed up to some MS community for which I received a confirmatory  email and with no option to cancel.My bank uses Skype and I spent hours trying to get through to them on several occasions due presumably to their lack of availability of staff. Each time I got through and repeatedly went through all of  their security checks we were cut on several times mid conversation. I could hear them but they were unable to hear me. One was when they were giving me instructions in online banking and we were cut off mid-transaction! It would be helpful to have readily accessible Skype technical support online  to report these losses  of connection issue  in order to discover where they lie.I note MS have not answered any of the feedback here so I guess all issues will remain unaddressed.

Skype,2022-03-12,N/A,I haven't used Skype too much but all of the experiences that I have had so far using it have been very pleasant and there were never any dropped calls from what I recall. Skype is definitely a great alternative if you do not want to give out your phone number to someone and want to do a video call.
Skype,2022-03-06,5,Ich hatte diesen Messenger vor 4 Jahren schon.
Skype,2022-02-24,1,"The worst experience of reporting fraud and getting them to act.  I have been trying to get hold of a friend for months he's been very ill, then he pops up on skype, so i ask him if he's ok.  During the chat i find its an imposter who either bought or stole the phone. I report to skype support chat because they cant be bothered with anyone phoning them oh no that's too much trouble.  And what do i get despite me providing evidence of the chat (screenshots) Oh they want me to get my friends ID  (OH THE FRIEND THAT I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET HOLD OF FOR MONTHS THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT). eH hello skype if he's died what do you want me to do, dig him up and ask him for it!.  I have provided all screenshots they asked for with clear evidence that someone else is using it and you do nothing. So much for preventing fraud, so much for privacy when the fraudster can see all chats and tel numbers.  So much for support, just excuses and non existent help.  This is the worst chat support i have ever experienced, all they would say they will let me know in 48 hours.  So the fraudster has 48 hours in which to damage the reputation of my friend by doing goodness knows what.  Stupid question, not a lot of answers, if i could have given Skype a Zero rating i would."

Skype,2022-02-02,N/A,What other responsible company would grab your money if you don't use your service for a short while?
Skype,2022-01-31,1,Skype is charging me and yet I don't use the service. All attempts to cancel the subscription have failed because it redirects me to Microsoft and I have no option to cancel. Microsoft claims it's $0 for it but Skype charges me $30.48. Steer clear of Skype and Microsoft 365.
Skype,2022-01-17,1,"I discovered i have been paying twice for skype, with different cards. Skype said one payment was fraudulent, but offered no more help, just saying i should contact my bank."
Skype,2022-01-06,N/A,"I'm satisfied with the quality of audio calls. I don't use video though.Skype comes in handy if you have a remote job and need to collaborate with your colleagues. As for other purposes, the features may not be enough. For example, if I was giving private or group classes, I would probably prefer a video conferencing platform instead. But it's up to you, I remember Skype language lessons were extremely popular before the pandemic.Anyway, what you definitely can't do on Skype is send large files. There's a limit of 300MB."
Skype,2021-12-22,1,"I turned off auto renewal several months ago, yet they were still deducting funds from my account.

Skype,2021-11-04,3,"Bonjour, beaucoup d'avis divergents, c'est que tout n'est pas rose effectivement, pour le metier de base de Skype, la vidéo et le chat par internet ou mobile cela fonctionne plutot bien hélas avec quelques pannes....Pour la téléphonie, payante... les abonnements ou achats de crédit, il ne vaut mieux pas s'engager avec de gros achats ou forfait, car vous ne serez jamais remboursés... En plus si vous avez des crédits pour le téléphone et que vous ne les utilisez pas au bout de 180 jours d'inactivité vos crédit sont désactivé, puis absorbés, si vous ne les réactivez pas, il disparaissent dans les caisses de SKYPE... c'est comme cela que l'on gagne de l'argent sans rien faire donc sans contrepartie... Quand au service commercial pour la téléphonie, ne comptez pas dessus, il est virtuel, plus précisément il est inexistant... pour retrouver vos crédits mettez un post incendiaire sur internet cela fonctionne plutot bien, car la procédure de récupération des crédits est cachée aux clients, et vous aurez une réponse à l'anglo saxonne   du type "" Désolé, nous allons essayer de nous améliorer "" sans excuse bien sur, cela coute trop cher les excuses, ce n'est pas dans le prix."
Skype,2021-11-03,1,The app won't show notifications. There are other apps out there that actually work
Skype,2021-10-29,3,N/A
Skype,2021-10-27,1,"Strange feature --keep ""hiding"" customer credit/money in the account away from time to time. I had to charge money in several times as I want to make some phone calls, but  late you can't find it anymore. You have to call them to ""active"" your money. once money is  in, you can't get them out or use it for useful things, expect stay there for future phone call. Why I need Skype if your mobile give your lot minutes free calls ? I have to call them to make my balance showing there. Believed lot people suffers this issue  --they thought they have no money left in their accounts , but the fact is the correct balance is  not showing ... That's very bad!!!"
Skype,2021-10-24,N/A,"For a long time I had booked several phone numbers and country packages from Skype. The quality of service was acceptable, but not really good. Now that my credit card account had been debited multiple times, I decided to cancel all Skype services immediately. So I haven't been a Skype customer for weeks, I deleted my Skype account and expressed my criticism. But: Although I have canceled all services, attempts are still being made to withdraw money for subscriptions that are supposed to be expiring. The emails that you receive from Skype indicate that you should hurry up with the payment in order to be able to continue using the allegedly (in fact no longer) existing services. If many of my fellow men were to claim that Skype is a criminal and fraud company, I would in fact have no counter-argument. These methods are absolutely dubious and beyond the line of fraud and theft. It is also significant that no one from Skype responds to the reviews shown here. So my insight: stay away from Skype. I will never again cooperate with a Microsoft company, let alone buy something that brings Microsoft profit. Just bad and dishonest.GERMAN: Über geraume Zeit hatte ich mehrere Telefonnummern und Länderpaket von Skype gebucht. Die Servicequalität war akzeptabel, doch nicht wirklich gut. Nun, da man x-fach von meinem Kreditkartenkonto abgebucht hatte, habe ich mich dazu entschlossen, alle Skype-Services sofort zu stornieren. Seit Wochen bin ich also kein Skype-Kunde mehr, habe auch das Skype-Konto gelöscht und meine Kritik geäußert. Aber: Obgleich ich alle Services storniert habe, versucht man weiterhin, Geld für angeblich auslaufende Abonnements abzubuchen. Die e-Mails, welche man von Skype erhält, weisen darauf hin, dass man sich mit der Zahlung beeilen sollte, um die angeblich (tatsächlich längst nicht mehr) bestehenden Services weiter nutzen zu können. Sollten zahlreiche meiner Mitmenschen behaupten, Skype sei ein Verbrecher- und Betrügerunternehmen, so hätte ich in der Tat kein Gegenargument. Diese Methoden sind absolut unseriös und jenseits der Grenze zu Betrug und Diebstahl. Bezeichnend ist auch, dass niemand von Skype auf die hier gezeigten Kritiken eingeht. Meine Erkenntnis deshalb: Finger weg von Skype. Ich werde niemals mehr mit einem Microsoft-Unternehmen kooperieren, schon garnicht etwas kaufen, was Microsoft Profit bringt. Einfach nur übel, schlecht und unehrlich."

Skype,2021-09-13,1,I come here to complain about this Time Wasting Crap that Microsoft has manage to ruin people's life with. This Skype rubbish & forced upgrade to Windows 10 thing should have Microsoft sued.People should rise up against this Fxxking thief of a company.
Skype,2021-09-04,1,"I stopped auto renewal several months ago, but noticed they were still taking money out of my account.

Skype,2021-08-13,N/A,"It's abuse, plain, clear and simple. It's intentional theft, equally plain, clear and simple. And I dare and defy Skye/Microsoft to even try to prove me wrong. I pay for a number (have been paying, annually, for many years) and a ""monthly plan"" and as time has passed, Skype has gotten worse: not ringing through, blocking numbers for no reason (I didn't block them), dropping calls, ""failing"" calls. There's nothing to work with in ""settings"" of any sort. There's no ""person"" to offer assistance. Their ""virtual assistant"" is a piece of coding nonsense. And THAT makes the intent to defraud customers all the more obvious! Furthermore,  I'm willing to ""call-out"" ANY positive review posted here as being made by someone either with a vested interest in the company or being handsomely paid to lie. There's NOTHING ""positive"" that can be said about Skype or ANY of their ""products/services"". How I DO look forward to an announcement of a law suit where-by Skype/Microsoft will be forced to refund fees and charges AND have to pay damages, inconveniences, losses, and general sufferings. It truly is time to toss Skype into the bin... and their employees as well because they too, are aware of the fraudulent, illegal practises going on."
Skype,2021-08-13,5,Skype is great! I have been thoroughly satisfied with using it! There is simply nothing wrong with it 😁
Skype,2021-08-05,1,"This seems to be very common that people's accounts are blocked for no reason other than system did it for suspicious activity 🤔 recognized in your account. I never used Skype but I have been forced by some people in the industry to use it because that's the way they mostly communicate with (plainly stupid). Luckily many realize skype is trash and are moving on. I will never ever use or buy any Microbial products and make sure to influence everyone around me to do the same and take the right decisions: I wish everyone just used Telegram or any Apple instant chatting service, so that companies like Microsoft and Samsung go bankrupt; they will surely do. It's just a matter of time."
Skype,2021-07-15,1,"- er en passende beskrivelse af den evolution Skype gennemgår.Jeg har været en trofast bruger af Skype gennem mange år, og bevidnet hvordan produktet er blevet forringet til ukendelighed.1) Ringekvalitet burde være den bedste men overgåes uden konkurrence af applikationer som fx. WhatsApp, Messenger etc. 2) Hovedet på sømmet er at jeg har forudbetalt for et nummer, hvor jeg opdager at det ikke længere virker. Deres support manager oplyser der er et ""generelt problem med kald til danske skype numre"", lover at eskalere min sag,  men vender blot retur med en mail om at de ""desværre ikke kan refundere mit abonnement, og tak for den tid jeg har været kunde""... Ingen teknisk løsning, og dette har jeg oplevet flere gange med deres support. Det eneste håb for et bedre Skype er, at de ser kunderne forsvinder. Indtil da, så er de komplet ligeglade."

Other software does it so elegantly but not Skype!!
Skype,2021-05-28,1,Skype trækker det årlige abonnement 2 gange. Det har de gjort i mere end 3 år. Det er umulig at få fat i en medarbejder til personlig betjening. Nar jeg skriver til dem sker det ikke noget.
Skype,2021-05-20,1,Their Tariffs are so confusing. When you look at their worldwide tariff it gives a list of countries (63) you can can on mobiles and landlines EG South Africa landline only) but when you go onto the tariff for a specific country again South Africa you are offered landlines and mobile numbers to call. when you try to get information as to why this is the bot they use is as useful as a chocolate teapot. There's nowhere where you can actually speak to a human or email them. I can see why this company is struggling as why more and more people are using other companies. NO CUSTOMER SERVICES AT ALL

(When tested out the UWP app I can't even get the message sending/receiving to work properly) Generally, with the desktop app, some features is almost working, like getting the messages sent and received even if I'm logged into several devices.Also, for most part, the voice chat with cameras is working.The major problem is, that it's quite often stop responding and I need to shut it down, almost every day! I'm always trying to run the latest version. It's performance is sluggish. It's like there is some background thread going for full speed. I'm not sure if it's caused by some sort of dead-lock or race condition?To sum up, it's probably one of the application I use most, and I'm also pretty unsatisfied. I rate it 2/5.

Not ideal for my business, but I cannot spend any more time chasing them up.When you need to contact them, it takes a significant amount of time waiting in queues and then waiting for each response as the support operators assist multiple people at a time.  They then never get back to you when they promise (despite telling them I don't believe they will get back to me - they insisted they definitely will and make promises which they inevitably always break).Taking this service has been a big mistake."

Jeg var blandt de første brugere og var super glad for Skype i mange år. Alt fungerede bare perfekt. Det hele blev ødelagt, da amerikanske BigTech Microsoft opkøbte Skype Communications for 8,5 milliarder dollars og Skype blev degraderet til at være en division i organisationen. Jeg bemærkede hurtigt, at servicen og standarden for tekniske løsninger blev markant dårligere, fordi Microsoft er total ligeglad med kvalitet og forbrugerne. Fx: tekniske problemer med Skype bare i dag: jeg kan ikke se mit eget profil billede og profil billederne af mine kontakter. Kan jeg få hjælp fra Microsoft Skype Support? Der er svaret: nej, fordi de er ligeglad med alt og alle.

Når jeg på anbefalet vis vil lukke for abonnementet henviser Skype til Microsoft og Microsoft (som jeg dog kunne komme i kontakt med) henviser til Spotify. Desværre kan jeg ikke komme i kontakt med Skype ved at ringe til en support - det har de vist ikke. Jeg har dog forsøgt at kontakte dem via chat, men der er det ikke en medarbejder, men vist en robot eller lignende, der chatter med en. Der bliver foreslået diverse vejledninger, som jeg allerede har forsøgt mig frem med, men de virker ikke efter hensigten. Der står også noget om, at hvis man har oprettet abonnementet via iPhone skal det lukkes via iPhone. Jeg har dog ikke iPhone længere, så måske det er problemet, men det kan jo ikke være rigtigt, at det skal være sådan. Langt om længe lykkedes det mig i efterår 2020 at få fat i en eller anden chatsupport, som vist var fra Indien (som jeg håber var fra Skype), som ville se på det, men intet er sket her flere måneder efter. Og jeg har selvfølgelig ikke fået nogen bekræftelse eller noget dokumentation på mail. Så nu prøver jeg som så mange andre, at få banken til at lukke for den betaling fremadrettet. Hold nu op, hvor har jeg brugt meget tid på dette. Utroligt at Skype kan komme afsted med det. De må tjene mange penge på det."

Now one can call via wifi on your cell phone, or text, etc.  I hadn’t used Skype for a long time and got a reminder.  I wanted a $8 refund.NOT POSSIBLE .  Doesn’t seem right. Sure, I could transfer my credit, but nobody uses Skype anymore! Thankful they only took me for $8."

Skype,2021-01-29,5,"Ein nützliches Programm, sehr vertrauenswürdig und einfach zu bedienen"
Skype,2021-01-25,1,"I cannot recommend Skype to anyone if you need to use it professionally. The only good thing I can say about it is that it has a fairly consistent reasonable quality of sound and connection... But that you can get easily and anywhere nowadays.... And that is where the list of Skype-benefits stops. In many countries Skype (one of the first and biggest providers of online phone service in the world!) cannot issue local phone numbers. The number of countries where you can apply for a local Skype number are in fact very limited. Even in Europe they are scarse!...Then there's the invoices. Like many bigtech companies, Skype (Microsoft) is for some reason not able or willing to provide clients any kind of an invoice for their purchases. The number of countries where Skype can provide a VAT-invoice is -again- very limited. But why not -at least- provide clients with a downloadable pdf-invoice with the details that they can find online in their account??? How difficult can it be!???... For business purposes Skype is totally useless, unless maybe if you live in one of those few countries where they do provide the full service. However, in that case you still have to suffer from Skype's horrible client service. Then there's of course the question whether one should use Skype for private communication. Well, you could (I sometimes do, if it is unavoidable) However, there's enough reason not to do so. Foremost, there is the privacy issues. Skype will collect your data and use it for God knows what. In fact, you're better off using messengers like Wickr (especially for professional use) Signal or (less safe) Telegram. These messengers don't provide phone numbers unfortunately, but they do allow you to make voice and some even video calls too. Look into it... Finally, my advice when it comes to using voip: there's lots of really good, specialized providers of voip-services nowadays (offering phone numbers and many more features like call recording for example). Look around and you'll find one that you like. My experience is that the smaller ones often give the best service at the best conditions. Just stay away from Skype!... You'll save yourself lots of headache..."
Skype,2021-01-25,1,"If insanity exist to qualify a business, Skype earned the title!- horrible costumer service - No live agent to escalate an ongoing issue- offers a subscription plan on their website a a certain price per a year subscription with 15% discount but the credit card doesn’t go through it says the card info is not valid, but then your CC purchases go through every time, so you end up with 5-6 purchases, of course being ultimately cancelled. Then you’re stock - spending hours on chats and not going anywhere- if you have several accounts and don’t remember the password then too bad no one can help you- why all your accounts cannot be managed in one place?- a total disrespect of their costumers - paid an annual subscription of $142  nine months ago and unable to use the service - bottom line I’m stocked and see no possibilities"

It's easy to connect and find contacts, you can see who is online, you have a record of how long your calls last, you can voice or video call, you cant send images and chat while on the call.The only issue I have come across is while screen sharing, Skype starts to massively lag and often cannot keep up.

I then had to buy again, at the new higher price of over £40.The online support person tried to instruct me how to do it right in future, but even his instructions first were completely wrong. The eventual way to do it was not at all clear, so it's unsuprising that I was unable to do it by myself. (I'm a regular computer user and good with websites/technology but still couldn't find it myself.)However, in the end Microsoft still refused to let me have the original price - the one it had emailed me about and that I've paid all this time - saying it has reviewed its subscription prices.I would have been fine if it had just wrote to me before the subscription renewal to say that it can't continue at the old prices. But it didn't. It tried to take payment at the original price and then, because it's website is a bit sucky, I ended up on the new price. I think I should be entitled to a refund and I'm surprised and disappointed that they didn't offer better customer service on this occasion.Unfortunately I am stuck with them though. Although there are ways to port skype landline numbers, their price for the landline number is simply too competitive - even at the higher price of £40ish per year."

""We evaluated your appeal and verified your account was properly closed for a serious violation of the Microsoft Services Agreement. Pursuant to our terms, we cannot reactivate your account, nor provide details as to why it was closed. This represents Microsoft’s final communication regarding this account.""

I haven't found ANY exact info about what can you possibly broke in terms of your ""code of conduct""...No exact numbers in terms of daily / weekly / monthly connections, no info about restrictions etc.Don't get me wrong - we can easily dismiss Skype from our messengers for the clients and ask them to use Telegram, Wattsapp or good old ICQ for further connections. In addition - I'm strongly disagreed with their disposition on following:""We have seen abusive behavior that includes one or more of the following:﻿Sending excessive new contact requestsReporting excessive abuse reports on other accountsSearching an excessive amount of contacts in SkypeAbusive behaviour they saying, comparing me with a spammer? Sending excessive new contact requests - what is ""excessive""? Where is a measure or volume of it, declared in your ""Code of conduct""? Reporting excessive abuse reports on other accounts - had reported only several contacts for heavy spam. Again - where is the number, conducting that ""excessive"" amount?Searching an excessive amount of contacts in Skype  - same as above. If you have an exact number of those searches (which in my opinion - utterly weird to even apply for) - kindly show it to me, so I'll be aware of it.Summarizing all above: me personally and my firm, my colleagues and our clients using Skype as a way of communication, not for spam (to make it clear once and for all).

Added connection charges. Awful UI. Dropping calls....After many years using Skype as my primary telephony service I’m leaving. I wish I didn’t have to. But I really have no choice."
Skype,2020-06-18,N/A,For interoffice communication it is great but for group video its not as easy to use or navigate. Depends on what you are trying to do but there are other good options out there for video.
Skype,2020-06-17,N/A,I had an Skype account since 2003 and was great to use. However now Microsoft links the account to the same email of a computer. But this feature is not available on old accounts. So my credit and agenda is lost. They request me to buy new credit.Worst think is that Microsoft customer service is fooling me sending my request on a dead end questionnaire loop. What a pity that Skype was bought by Microsoft and their   incompetent customer service.So unfortunately after having a great service the only option is to use other comm app.
Skype,2020-06-14,1,Horible search enginesaves files for only 30 daysBad performance Actually unbelievable that this is one of the most popular communication platforms in 202 with the features it has.
Skype,2020-06-08,1,"My Skype experience has been awful.  I had used the app for a video conference days ago and then didn't open it again. However, I was informed by a fellow user that I was seen on Skype '7 hours ago.'  This was untrue!  Then, I signed out and back in. This same person said after I did that, my status changed to 'last seen days ago.'  I have tried to reach Skype for help and that is impossible.  My account has been closed and I will not be returning to Skype.I do not typically write reviews but I don't like being seen on-line when I am not on-line and no one at Skype/Microsoft is available to help me.Goodbye, Skype."
Skype,2020-06-07,1,"Can't reach my friend on Skype today. It's not doing the ringing tone at my end, just the double beep thing, it's ringing at his end but a message appears saying unable to connect please try again later. When you DO connect the speech is garbled and the video quality varies from crystal clear to a smudge on virtually every call I make. It was light years better before Microsoft got hold of it, in fact Microsoft Messenger was good too. Been trying now for 30 minutes and no chance of a connection:-("
Skype,2020-06-03,1,Skype SucksThey really missed their chance. Im glad there are other platforms for video conferencing now since skype bugged and i've lost the ability to access my account.

Skype,2020-06-02,1,Skype is just garbage compared to all other videochat services
Skype,2020-05-29,5,All good.Best features set in the communication world. Great sync between moble and desktop. The best emoticons ever. Best call quality. WhatsApp sucks with video call quality.
Skype,2020-05-28,1,"Of all the chat/call apps available, Skype is the worst.It used to be great, but then Microsoft bought Skype and decided to ruin it.Now you aren't allowed multiple chat windows, chat messages can take hours to arrive. Notifications that you have new messages can just not happen. People think they are calling you, but your PC never rings. Managing the options through the settings is a nightmare.Use anything else if you have the option. The only thing it is good for is calling ""real"" phones. The international calling rates are pretty cheap."

Skype,2020-05-26,N/A,I rarely use Skype to be honest. There’s so many easier alternatives. But when do use it I find it needlessly complex and unergonomic. Perfect example: all I wanted to do today was see through a friends webcam whilst simultaneously texting through the inbuilt text option. After twenty minutes of fiddling I couldn’t work out if it was even possible. I had managed to take a screenshot somehow but that’s it.

Allem voran die neue Desktopanwendung, seit ein paar Jahren, die viel viel schlechter ist als die ursprünglichen Versionen. Eine Anwendung die umständlich zu bedienen ist und stark mit Gewohnheiten bricht, trifft eben auf Ablehnung.Microsoft ist wie König Midas, nur dass alles was Microsoft anstatt zu Gold zu Schlunz wird.

Skype,2020-05-07,1,WHY IS IT SO HARD TO CHANGE A MOBILE NUMBER... DELETING MY ACCOUNT AND ADDING MY NEW ONE ON THAT NEW PROFILE IS EASIER... WHEN THAT HAPPENS THAT MEANS ITS TOO COMPLICATED.
Skype,2020-05-06,1,"It's become a steaming pile of poop ever since Microsoft acquired Skype. It used to just work. Now my messages take ages to load. Today I just got locked out of my account for no apparent reason, just some vague ""security"" excuse and I could only unlock it by giving them my phone number. Terrible product. Would NOT spend a single cent on it."
Skype,2020-05-03,1,"I used to work on this product, left in 2013. Since I left, Microsoft has absolutely destroyed this wonderful communications tool by aggressively moving it from a simple application to an ""APP"" based, cloud driven pile of garbage that tries to hook into too many other Microsoft products and accounts, then just when Microsoft reach peak unusability, they stop developing the platform. Teams is just as bad, you'll have to use an application with poor security, or they routes its communications through China to get a decent video call experience this lockdown.Literally 3/4 of the calls with family on Skype consist of troubleshooting it not working."
Skype,2020-04-30,1,"The latest update of Skype has wowed much in the audience, but honestly it’s just an app. You cannot possibly expect us to prefer it over top picks like WhatsApp when you kick users for no reason, I hope you take this to heart and personally I really hope you improve Skype. I’ve been kicked out two times for no reason and I’ve informed all my children who told their friends that Skype just doesn’t work. It’s a no-go for my entire neighbourhood because they all experience the same flaw. Fix it or Microsoft will be a piece of junk in a few years. All it takes is one hater. I was happily chatting when the app removed me from my account, twice, once I sign in the same thing happens again and again. I urge you to change the way it functions. You are not protecting your customers by shoving them away. I assure you there’s nothing wrong with us, it’s Microsoft that sucks. Please improve it. I hope we’ve no personal feelings as I’ve seen many experience this problem. Skype logs me out and says there’s something wrong with my account, so I go to account recovery and Guess what they tell me? They say they haven’t enough info to recover. I gave them my email, contacts, personal information such as birth date and they haven’t the heart to accept a simple request. If this is protecting your customers, then don’t protect your customers anymore."
Skype,2020-04-29,1,Locks you out of your account for no reason to extort additional personal information from you. Either you had over more personal information or you don't get your account back
Skype,2020-04-28,1,Skype number - paid subscription.Please avoid it at any cost.  It doesn't work.People cannot connect or when they call me can't hear me. It's nothing to do with my microphone because it works when I do test calls. I tested 3 devices same story again and again. And it works when I call someone back. I cancelled my subscription. There is no way to get in touch with anyone to discuss technical issues or get refunds.  Big disappointment. I would call it a petty theft.  Skype charges connection fees too on top of normal rates.  Premium rates for non working service.It so bad Microsoft purchased it. It is like with their other products.  They just get worse and worse every day.

Skype,2020-04-23,1,My Skype account was hacked. (I since learned there is a way to do that and I dont want to give too much information as to how that was done. It was very obvious as to what they did when I looked at my account.) Through the auto recharge set up with my PayPal and then with my bank account the hackers managed to take hundreds of euro from me. They ran through my Skype credit and straight into the auto recharge which is linked with my PayPal account. Multiple repeat takings emptied my PayPal balance inside a minute. Then in a domino effect they used the same method with the auto recharge function to get into my bank account. By the time more than 400 euro was taken my banks fraud detection shut it down. In the end the hackers cleaned me out of more than 600 euro. My Bank paid me back as did PayPal. The scam and hack is/was very obvious. Could not be calls as autorecharge went through consequetively within seconds running into hundreds of euro. Skype did not and have not been co operative at all with this. Disgusted with Skype and strongly recommend everyone to not have auto recharge set up with Skype. You are open to the same hacking and scam I was and your bank may not be as supportive as mine was. Skype certainly wont be.

I had used skype for years before with no trouble whatsoever.  Now it is so frustratingly bad, and the support is non-existent.1) I am unable to access my old skype username and identity, it is impossible to delete it and it is still searchable.2) It took over an hour to make contact between my brother and I on skype as it was impossible to find each other on the 'search contacts'.  I say this as two tech-savvy people who were on the phone to each other the whole time, trying to link up.  Totally impossible for any of my elderly family to fathom by themselves.3) The 'MeetMe' as a Guest simply did not work for my aunt - it repeatedly asked her to create a profile.4) Trying to set up a profile is impossible for an elderly person to manage - Multi-factor authentication and the captcha puzzle - despite two hours patient coaching we could not manage to help my aunt through this - her eyesight is not very good.5) We set up a profile ourselves for our aunt, but now cannot log in to it as it says we are breaching some sort of protocol.  I could just scream with frustration, WHY IS IT SO HARD!I would swap products but then we've only just managed to get some of the other family on, and now we can no longer visit them to help.Sort it out Microsoft, this is appallingly bad."

If you rely on a Skype in number for personal or business use don’t because if it goes down you will get zero help and be left on your own)I hate leaving poor ratings but I see now why Microsoft (who own Skype) already is rated bad. My experience is truly horrendous. They asked us to validate the account and sent multiple messages then locked us out (validator app on the office computer seemed to malfunction so we requested email confirmation) and we received the automated message below. Not only did they cut off the account they disconnected all the Skype in numbers (there was no issue with Skype) which meant my mother in her 90s and other elderly family members can't reach us and are distraught. My mother is in a care home very frightened about the virus and kept crying to the staff saying ""my son is ill"" this is not the case but she is used to phoning the Skype in number as we are in different countries. We have used Skype since the first year it started and never had an issue this has been catastrophic causing great distress to several people in theirr 80s and 90s and the message below shows support is non existent and as far as ""All duplicate requests will be closed and responses will be sent on the original escalation."" Does this show they just don't care?

Skype,2020-04-03,1,"I have used Skype for years to connect with family and friends regularly.  We are all located in various countries. In spite of some occasional technical problems, I was always happy to have the ability to not just connect but see the faces of my loved ones!  One of my friends is elderly, lives in Germany, and does not own a computer or smart phone - only a home phone.  I started a subscription 10 years ago allowing me to call her for 60 minutes per month.  This subscription was to be automatically renewed year over year.  For ten years this worked beautifully.  In March 2020, during our Corona virus self quarantine, I checked in with my friend in Germany a number of times.  The calls frequently dropped and I called her back. I did not pay attention that I had used up my 60 minutes for the month.  When I attempted to call my house bound friend on April 1, my international subscription was cancelled.  After finally reaching a live person at Microsoft Customer Service, I was advised of alternative Skype subscription which is 8 times more expensive.  I explained the reason why I had overused my 60 minutes during March, but my account still showed I had a subscription.  I was advised that the old subscription would not be available to me until March 2021, if then!  This is the company policy!  During this time of COVID 19, where all companies who are able, are doing whatever they can to help people who are under terrible stress, one of the largest and most lucrative companies in the world has cancelled my $13.50 annual subscription.  Microsoft, you should be ashamed!  Mr. Gates would be ashamed to know that in spite of all the good he is doing in the world, this is what has happened in his old company!"
Skype,2020-04-03,N/A,"My mind just cannot fathom how is it possible that a company with unlimited funds has such a disastrous product in its portfolio. I remember loving skype back before it was bought by Microsoft. It was simple and most importantly, it worked. I am forced to use skype because the whole company uses it and let me tell you, it's painful.It's really slow. Sometimes it closes by itself another time it will not turn on. New messages sometimes don't show up for no apparent reason. Copy function on images doesn't work.  I always have to print screen it or save it to use it elsewhere. Copy function on messages sometimes copies the message two times -> you copy Hello, paste it and its HelloHelloand so many other bugsThe icing on the cake is that there is another version besides the desktop one. The one from Microsoft store and boy oh boy, I don't even know how is it possible but that one is even worse."

Skype,2020-04-02,1,"Skype is a disaster since it was purchased by Microsoft. It is the year 2020, if people do not have the option to have separate skype accounts for: work, friends & job interviews or hobbies then they do not have the option either to participate in modern life. Microsoft has a responsibility here that goes beyond the corporate one. At my workplace we disregarded Skype as an option because it is not the safest way to communicate with clients. Politically speaking it is a mess that Microsoft is unwilling to treat users in a decent manner. The security questions are illegally forcing millions of users to provide Microsoft with information which they have no right to know (phone number, billing information, credit card information even if you didn't sign up with it etc.). And they are leaving European and American users no other choice than to use foreign services which will spy on them (as well) but use that to another country's advantage. Personally, (I am located in Germany) I haven't had access to any of my Skype accounts on any of my devices since 2015. I didn't sign up again for it either and I am using different services for work as well as privately. I am not going to give Microsoft my phone number and I will not use the service again. Even Whatsapp has the option for video calls and I consider it to be quite awkward when some businesses give a pass to Skype but use a ""freetime"" app like Whatsapp instead. That is downright embarrassing for a company. Microsoft had Skype since 2011 which means that they have failed to improve Skype for nine years. The corona outbreak will give Skype some superficially increased numbers but after that I expect the service to die since competitors don't wait nine years to hear, let alone impress users."

Skype,2020-03-26,1,"Ich hatte in Skype Konto seit 2009. Damals habe ich es viel genutzt, sogar mit Guthaben und war sehr zufrieden. Aber es hatte mich schon immer gestört, dass ich das Guthaben immer nach 180 Tagen reaktivieren musste mit einem Anruf.2019 erhielt ich eine email, dass Skype jetzt mit dem Microsoft Konto verwendbar wäre (bis dahin hatte ich noch nicht gewusst, dass Skype seit 2011 zu microsoft gehörte). In der Mail tauchte plötzlich ein (automtaisch generierter) Microsoft Nutzername meines bereits bestehenden Microsoft Kontos auf. Als ich versucht habe, mich mit meinem alten Skype Konto Name anzumelden, hieß es, der Nutzername sei nicht vorhanden. Beim Eingeben der emailadresse hieß es das Passwort sei falsch. Nach zusenden eines Links zum zurücksetzen des Passwort wurde ich automatisch über das Microsoft Konto angemeldet und musste mein Skype Konto komplett neu einrichten. Alle meine alten Daten (Chats und Kontakte) und vor allem das Guthaben waren weg.Nach 2 h in der Warteschleife der Chat Hilfe von Microsoft war ich endlich mit einer Dame verbunden.Ihr Deutsch war allgemein etwas holprig und manchmal schwer verständlich, wie von einem Online Übersetzer übersetzt. Das Problem wurde in der folgenden Stunde, die ich mit ihr schrieb, leider nicht gelöst, die Person war sehr bemüht, aber es wurden nur Vermutungen angestellt, woran es liegen könnte. Die Angaben widersprachen sich aber teilweise: Einerseits sei bei den alten Skype accounts die emailadresse nur als Sicherheitskontakt hinterlegt gewesen und nicht automatisch verlinkt. Andereseits hieß es, dass die Skype accounts in Microsoft accounts überführt wurden. Meine Vermutung, dass mein alter Account überschrieben wurde mit dem auf die gleiche emailadresse laufenden Microsoft account wurde vehement verneint, andererseits wurde vermutet, dass der Account wegen Inaktivität gelöscht worden sein konnte. Die Regelung für Löschung nach 2 jähriger Inaktivität trat aber erst 2019 in Kraft, gilt eigentlich nicht für Accounts mit Guthaben... Ich glaube, die verstehen selbst nicht, was das System beim Umzug der ganzen Accounts von Skype zu Microsoft gemacht hat...Es wurde Witerleitung an die nächsthöhere Support Ebene und weiterer Support per Mail versprochen.

There is no way I can change the linked email address without logging in to skype, absurdly. They have asked me to go to a URL with my Microsoft account, which I tried, but it didn't redirect even though I specially created a Microsoft account. To log in to that Microsoft account, they forced me to give them my phone number. So now on top of my money they also stole my data. Tried logging into Skype again after reinsatlling, same thing - turning in circles and no access to my Skype account with the money on it. Tried to contact their customer support, spent 4 hours waiting in the chat and then gave up after being the next in line for more than an hour. It's hopeless - forget Microsoft. I am trying to call through Viber or other apps now. Thanks for stealing my money, Skype... DO NOT USE SKYPE ANYMORE! Microsoft will make sure you regret it."
Skype,2020-03-24,N/A,"Frankly speaking, I didn’t like Skype and preferred not to use it at all because of the poor quality of connection, constant freezes and other problems. But I am really glad that they managed to change. The connection quality has been improved significantly. Now I use Skype much more often. It is good progress I might say."
Skype,2020-03-21,1,"If I write all the bad things of Skype 8, then I am afraid the available space will not enough. So I will just write this. Very slow!!! I use i5 and 16GB RAM but still slow.If I could give zero stars I will give zero stars, or even minus 5 starsI miss Skype version 7."
Skype,2020-03-19,1,"If I could give it less stars I would. audio has never worked consistently on desktop version. Just made a call on the mobile and I have the option of seeing me with my contact in a little circle or half and half. I know what I look like, I want to see the other person"
Skype,2020-03-19,3,The newest version of Skype uninstalled itself and thank you very much for not-doing Skype when I had to go to very important videoconference. I had to install it once again. Some of programmers should think twice about their careers.
Skype,2020-03-18,1,"Gennemført forfærdeligt program!!! Opfører sig som en virus, der er mere eller mindre umulig at få til at stoppe med at starte sig selv og få afinstalleret.Hold jer langt væk fra det snylter program!!!"
Skype,2020-03-16,1,"Videocall quality invariably glitchy, impossible to find clear instructions on how usernames work (do you send contacts the live: part or not?), perennial sign-in issues that send you on infinite security loops, every option you want (if it even exists) hidden in secret menus."

Skype,2020-03-04,1,"I subscribed to Skype for international calling and after 2 month using just wanted to canceled Although I cancelled my subscription yesterday they charged me for nothing. Poor service, poor customer experience. Very bad never use it again. Never."
Skype,2020-03-02,1,"I couldn't even place a call even though I have a subscription. I had to cancel 3days into the  30days free trial. they then had the nerve to tell me I can continue using till the 30days is up--yeah right! you can't even connect me to my subscription even when I have paid subscription. Customer/technical service will never get back to you on your problems.  If I never had outlook mail as an alternate mail, I wouldn't want to mess with any microsoft products...well except the ones force on my throat by my employer because the majority of companies are using windows products.l"
Skype,2020-02-29,N/A,I am not sure why people posting many bad things about that people but I can really tell you that I am more than happy to use all of this products and Microsoft only improved it and changed to it instead of their Microsoft Messenger (do you remember it?)
Skype,2020-02-26,N/A,"Skype was once an advanced piece of communication software. Most Microsoft modifications have resulted in negative impact on this program. The logic of the user interface is complicated and difficult to handle. Simple features available in most other programs, such as copy and paste are hidden in some sub menues and difficult to detect. I always have the impression that a computer freak w/o any real life knowledge has been told to change the program without adding a useful feature. This program will one day die as many other MS products."
Skype,2020-02-17,1,just awful. Microsoft killed it dead
Skype,2020-02-15,1,"I had a Skype account 3 years ago and it was great. I tried accessing it recently but had forgotten my password. When I tried to reset password, I was asked all kinds of questions by Microsoft including my credit card info if I had purchased their products in the past. I am not about to provide that info just so that I can reset my password. FaceTime is much much better and easier to use. So long Skype."
Skype,2020-02-14,N/A,Skype used to be good - really good. Then Microsoft got involved and it went downhill.there is a lesson to be learned here - don't try to fix something that isn't broken. Far too many bugs & issues now.

Skype,2020-02-04,1,I just cannot believe it is a product of Microsoft. The basic searching function is really horrible. It is just not working.
Skype,2020-02-03,1,"For most countries, voip phone calls using services like ""Line"", ""Whatsapp"", ""Facetime"", etc work well, and they are free voice calls - quality may not be great but no problem. Exception is calls to United Arab Emirates. For that, to call from UK, i either pay the mobile charge of £3 per month to call using international-reduced-fees, which is £0.14pm for UAE, or I used to use skype-to-go. But recently Skype-to-go simply connects and call is silent and if you don't hang up it ""eats up"" all your credit. Or, in calls at few seconds into the call, all you hear is same recorded conversation of initial few seconds, a loop of repeating, replaying what you, or the other person said - in my experience, this bug used up 10min of credit even after i hung up. *BE very careful with skype with credit* as it can become much more expensive than using your normal line to call. One may say, it was a bug, not Skype's fault, Skype still paying the PSTN calls, but when the service is unsuitable and doesn't deliver the required quality to hold a consumer conversation, they should not be allowed to charge for it. It is a badly designed Skype service, so as part of consumer rights, I shouldn't be charged for a service that doesn't work. Yet Skype has been getting away with this and no refund is provided."
Skype,2020-02-01,1,"Charged $200 to my skype account, told me it was fraudulent and refused to refund the money:""We understand that you are asking if Skype will refund the charges. I do apologize about it. However, we are unable to process refund for the fraudulent charges on the account. As previously suggested, we strongly advise you to contact your bank, to receive the money back from the unauthorized transactions, as well as to stop any unauthorized transaction being made in the future on either skype.com or any other website.

I have been trying for 3 months to cancel a subscription, but can't even when following their directions!!  I would like to choke all of them I so damn frustrated!!"
Skype,2020-01-27,3,Skype Lite on Android is the only redeeming quality that Skype has.... and even then sometimes there are missed notifications.
Skype,2020-01-25,N/A,"Très déçue de voir que le pack illimité Européen (mobile) est passé de 22 euros à 40 par mois.

Skype,2020-01-19,1,something always broken and general user interface is clumsy.

Skype,2020-01-07,N/A,"I've been one of the first users of Skype since its beginning. I was enthusiastic about it until it was bought by Microsoft and changed dramatically. Features that I loved simply disappeared and I wouldn't characterize it as user-friendly with these unnecessary and inexplicable changes.  I'm not the only one complaining; it's thousands of good old users who are disappointed. Some examples: Very bad synchronization with other devices. On Windows 10 having two windows when minimizing it!?! This is so frustrating! No alphabetical order of contacts option on the desktop version, like it used to be. Colorless and boring; too much black and white. I'm wondering if the developers really check if anything they change makes any sense or makes our life easier. When something is excellent, it doesn't need to change just for the sake of making it upbeat or whatever. I still use it on a daily basis for my work, but I'm not the enthusiast I used to be."

Men jeg kan kun ringe til min kinesiske forlovedes mobil i Beijing, samt et 'udvalg' af fastnetnumre i DK. Saa man faar overhovedet ikke hvad man betaler for og hvad de oplyser, at deres automatiske betalingsabonnement daekker. Man kan heller ikke komme i kontakt med dem, nogen steder - intet telefonnummer nummer eller support e-mails/ sted at indsende 'tickets'. Virkelig lousy!!

Skype,2019-12-30,N/A,"Uso Skype quotidianamente per lavoro, ma da un mese a questa parte mi ritrovo un giorno si e un giorno a no a doverlo re-installare. Nello specifico, per avviarlo clicco sull'icona da desktop e non succede nulla, nessun segnale di vita. Spero che venga trovata una soluzione definitiva, come strumento di utilizzo sarebbe ottimale a parte questo inconveniente."
Skype,2019-12-30,N/A,"It started as a great innovative app years back and was extremely convenient and simple to use. Ever since Microsoft bought it, they just gradually destroy it, they remove useful features. Useful is the wrong word, they remove necessary features and it becomes bulkier, uglier and useless with every new update they implement. There were so many people who used to use this app for business and daily communications, but it's become unusable. R.I.P Skype"
Skype,2019-12-28,1,"Soi-disant « par mesure de sécurité, vous avez été déconnecté » ils obligent les utilisateurs à se connecter par une procédure « account.live.com » et de leur fournir un numéro de téléphone qui n’est pas obligatoire pour la création d’un compte Skype."
Skype,2019-12-26,1,"Skype is the most execrable piece of software that I ever have to use.  It's been like this for years and seems never to improve.  Tonight I called someone and the video was completely mashed - looking like the type of pattern one used to see on signal failures in analogue TVs about 30 years ago.  And there's no way of telling the high and mighty software owners!  This was after I upgraded to the ;atest version of the software on my last use of it, a few days ago. (That's nother thing, Skype has had more version releases than there are stellar bodies in the universe.  Why?).I really should move to somthing that works, but the trouble is thta so many people use it that one has little in the way of creating a driving force to move to something better.The other thing that I have disliked for years (going back to times long before Microsoft bought it) is that the whole user interface of the software is designed to suck you into it and make as much as possible out of me, the customer, as possible.  Asking for your contact lists etc. is for the birds, so transparently Sh**ty.Skype needs a huge clean-up and attitude change if it to get any form of positive score from me."
Skype,2019-12-25,1,"Skype used to be fantastic. A great way to make calls easily and was worth paying for. Now it is a joke. For an entire year, with repeated attempts, I have not had a single call actually work out. The reception is abysmal at all times. Thankfully there are alternatives that are so much better than this rubbish"

Men efter denne opdatering vises Skype i Proceslinjen nede ved siden af uret til at være online men når vinduet åbnes vises det som at den stadig er ved at logge på.Det hænger jo ikke sammen. Har I standset Skype til brug med Windows 7 eller er der en fejl? Hvis det er en fejl må I meget gerne rette fejlen - Ellers er jeg bange for at jeg ikke længere vil bruge Skype, Normalt bruger jeg skype meget.Mvh. Heinrich Christiansen"
Skype,2019-12-14,1,Skype became a rip-off with no transparent terms specially for paid subscriptions. Would not recommend it.
Skype,2019-12-11,1,"Everything that was great about Skype is gone for a while now. This new Skype 8.5x looks like a kids toy, works slowish and sluggish, does its thing on its own without allowing users to disable/enable some basic things such as spelling checker. Also, it randomly started signing me out without the option to remember my password and sign me back in. Happens few times in a day."
Skype,2019-12-11,1,"Skype is broken, new version since 2018 or so sucks!"
Skype,2019-12-11,1,"I have never been a fan of Skype even at the best of times. Recently, I had an online tutor for my Hungarian lessons and he suggested that we video chat on Skype and I thought that that was fair enough. I went to log in and found out that I was banned/locked out for no reason! Despite trying absolutely everything, I could not get them to overturn the ban. I tried to create a new account but that turned out to be a palaver so we video chatted over a different app in the end. An absolute waste of time and space."

Skype,2019-11-23,1,"In an age where whatsapp and facebook messenger are available for free there is no use for skype, which is both costly and not very reliable. If you have credit on skype this is non-refundable so if you end up finding better solutions for wordwide communication skype will still keep your money forever or force you to use your credit on a platform you don't want or need to use. Ok customer service, not their fault the company they are working for has greedy and unfriendly policies. Stay away from skype, there are better solutions out there."
Skype,2019-11-20,N/A,people stopped to use skype so they decided to pre-install it inside windows. Genius.
Skype,2019-11-18,1,Skype is utter $hit
Skype,2019-11-17,1,New SKYPE was created for spying on users and their contacts. This is run and controlled now by NSA and HOMELAND with cooperation with other countries security services. They decides when Ypu can get connected with your contact and if You can send a video or not.
Skype,2019-11-17,1,"I have been trying to cancel my skype subscription for months following the online instructions sent in their e-mails to me, to no avail. You are not able to reply to the e-mail and there is no contact e-mail or number. After paying £14 every quarter for months I cancelled my subscription with my bank after trying to notify skype about this. I recently received several e-mails saying I needed to take urgent action and that my payment method had failed and then another e-mail several days later to say my subscription had been successful. As no money is coming out of my bank anymore, I am concerned that I am being charged money in accruing credit that I will have to pay at a later date. I am concerned this could affect my credit rating also. I have not used my account for years and have exhausted the different ways to try to contact them. I am actually considering approaching Citizens Advice about this. Catherine BeaumontSkype name: live:crampy123"

No time zone indicator so I'm waking people up at 3am.Suddenly bugging me for billing information, no thanks Microsoft, don't trust you with my card.

How do i get them to appear on my skype page so that i can use the app.? otherwise, my money is sitting in there, wasted.

Why doesn’t the iPhone app allow it to remember usernames and passwords.

I would suggest to anyone that if they can find another way of communicating, not to bother with Skype."

Skype,2019-07-19,1,There really hard to get in contact with. Ironically. Skype is the only way I can stay in touch with my husband while he’s in the states. But for some reason my subscription allows me to make calls but won’t allow any incoming calls it goes straight to busy. Supposebly it’s being escalated but I have no idea of how long. What’s going on. It’s so frustrating
Skype,2019-07-18,N/A,"I'd give it 0 stars if i could. No matter if it's on pc or a tablet or a phone, the Skype app isn't good. It's slow for everything. No-one seems to get notifications of messages or calls anymore. The gif section is pointless. The connecting and call quality isn't great. The whole app is a pain in the butt to use and pretty much everyone i know are migrating over to discord instead as it is just better than Skype at everything and they seem to actually listen to and care about their customers. Perhaps Skype has had its day? I certainly won't be reinstalling it the next time it breaks and i have to uninstall."
Skype,2019-07-14,1,"Ich nutze Skype seit Anfang an. Seit der Verbindung mit einem Microsoft Konto nicht mehr zu gebrauchen. Ständig Probleme, wenn man mehrere Konten nutzt.Lösung: Windows rausschmeißen!"
Skype,2019-07-11,1,If I could give Skype no stars I would! Terribly slow when typing messages and calls are not much better. I use it as little as I can but sometimes have to for business calls as work uses it. It was constantly updating and each up date it got worse. Not had an update for a while now thank goodness!

Skype,2019-07-09,5,"Skype is a great tool that allows us to be communicated at any time, either from our house to talk with family or friends, or from the company to talk to customers, or to have video calls or video conferences, we can also talk on the phone sometimes free or at very low prices, I recommend it."
Skype,2019-07-05,5,I use Skype for all of my communication needs. They have a good interface and plenty of features!
Skype,2019-07-05,1,"Navigation through the various functions is illogical. It's hit and miss whether it does what it should. The call quality is pretty good, but any positives are completely overshadowed by the appalling user experience. It needs a ground up redesign of the interface. It used to be great. Microsoft have completely ruined it."

Skype,2019-07-01,1,"After using the ""original Skype"" since inception, I can only say the Microsoft 8.  version is Hell disguised in a permanent nightmare !!The fact that version 7 has been totally obliterated by Microsoft, makes me not even trust the companies PC systems (which they actually pioneered !!)  Skype is a total, total misery, all that was logically practical, the most user friendly setup has been lost. The fact that Skype just logs out, in the middle of being used is hair-pulling... what bunch of ignorants  did program version 8??  can't cancel just one conversation, either all or nothing, to pick up a incoming call it takes forever, I lose most of them and have to call back. The list is too long to tell, and it just gets me aggravated. ONE MESSAGE TO MICROSOFT: Bring Skype version 7 back or you will lose a longtime customer for good! (PC, Software and all!!)"

Skype,2019-06-25,1,"Just had a call from my manager as I work from home. I answered Skype on my PC and it crashed (this is common). But he immediately called again before I restarted it and I had to answer on my backup: my mobile. As he spoke his voice came out of the speaker rather than the earpiece so I had to quickly reset the speaker option. Call over, I called Skype from my landline to check it was still working and the ring was now coming just from the earpiece of my mobile and PC headset. Why is it so awkward to set up the ring? It's not as if every other phone on the planet doesn't work this way. Obvious problems like the in-call keypad # not working when typed on a keyboard, are not being fixed. My headset mute never synchronizes. When active, the Skype icon is now a big black square. The old PC software worked, and was vastly superior but Microsoft has now blocked its use. Did anyone at Microsoft ask what users wanted for the new version? Does anyone there care any more?"

Skype,2019-05-21,N/A,Really disappointing!I reinstalled the app on my mac several times. It simply does not work and causing so much trouble :-( Also I hear from many others that they are tired of the business version not working out properly. I am pretty surprised that the private free Skype version obviously works better than the business solution...
Skype,2019-05-17,N/A,"Skype is horrible.  It seems to have to do an update every other day of the week and when it does it changes the download folder for messages, and causes the auto login not to work.  This is ridiculous.  Can anyone recommend an IM program that is needed for only two things:  1) Instant Message 2) File Transfer.   I don't need video or any bells and whistles.  Just a basic program that is one download and done (don't have to mess with it daily).    Anyone?????????"

Ich kenne das Programm seit 2005 und bin es mittlerweile wirklich leid. Jedes Mal wenn einer mit Skype ankommt, bekomme ich schon Magenzucken. Mein restliches Guthaben hätte ich noch gerne vertelefoniert und dann wird Schluss sein mit diesem Quatschprogramm!Wie kann ich nun vorgehen, um die Blockierung aufzuheben, damit ich wenigstens noch irgendwie mein Guthaben vertelefonieren kann?Danke!"
Skype,2019-05-07,1,"(facepalm) <= da versteht Skype was davon- RAM-Verbrauch: Verbrauch verhält sich wie bei einem Browser mit 20 Tabs offen. Ein Messenger sollte eigentlich so wenig wie möglich Ressourcen benutzen, damit andere Anwendungen problemlos laufen können. Jeglich eine Kopie von Web-Chats wie Slack, Facebook usw. Man hätte das viel besser machen können, ist aber andererseits momentan auch ein Trend.- Webcam-Übertragung: Jede 30 Minuten stürzt Skype ab. Das Schreiben mit anderen Leuten, während eine Cam-Sitzung scheint unmöglich zu sein.- Zur Insider-Preview und Fenster-Modus: Neue Fenster = keine Benachrichtigungen von anderen Fenster.Leider ist man in manchen Unternehmen auf Skype angewiesen.

The trap is set by something as innocent (and very frequent for the elderly) as forgetting your own password. This is used by Skype as an opportunity to suggest to the user to create a MS account with which to log into Skype. After the unsuspected user agrees, the trap closes in. His entire history and friends list in his old account are rendered inaccessible. Moreover, even years later when the user tries to log into to the old account, his current account is rendered inaccessible. Skype gets into an infinite loops saying that the user account or password are incorrect. This happens even after the user changes the password of his current account through sms authentication. This entire thing us cursed. Avoid!"

Skype,2019-04-04,1,"It is truly sad to see what has happened to skype since Microsoft acquired it.  Years ago there were some connection quality issues caused by very variable data-connection-quality (not skype's fault).

At the moment I cannot get any notification of receiving messages and my calls randomly drop out - only reestablishing 70% of the time. My contacts' status indications are rarely accurate. Despite having a 28-50Mb connection.Microsoft should be ashamed of themselves. I am now going to have to move to WhatsApp - which I have resisted for a couple of years, but now my 'experience has been improved' in Skype to the point that I give in."

Now the software is so slow that when I try to answer the phone, the caller gives up and hangs up before the software responds.Also, there is no way for the notification number to go away, when there is a new message. Once you get a message, the number stays with the Skype taskbar icon until you shut the software down, no matter how many times you open the chat with the new message.Because of the software issues, I'd have dumped this service years ago, but the phone number I purchased is the contact number we gave a lot of companies and vendors."

No individual chat windows, no customizable hot keys, could not resize the text input area, no font choices like font face and size. They eventually rolled out split window but only for the huge clunky windows 10 app and not for the desktop version.  Finally they forced users clinging to their fully functional version 7 into the terrible version 8 which lacks so many features of version 7 that it's not an ""upgrade"" at all it's a serious downgrade. They are not listening to the users who have voted highly on Uservoice for either the return of version 7 or to add the missing features into the version 8 desktop client (not the app).  This is unacceptable for people who paid for the service and for people who use this product for work and cannot get usual tasks done because some of the features they rely heavly upon have been removed."
Skype,2019-03-21,N/A,"Seriously Microsoft this is so sad. I usually dont write reviews but this app was bothering me know for months. First of all is the new UX design totally retarde d. I am a paying customer for Skype to Phone and took me a long time to find out how to even make a phonecall. The whole UX is very unpleasant. Then once i forgot my password. OMG what a drama to recover it. Had to solve some weird puzzles and then choose a password that i never used before. Who came up with this??? Thats the reason why people forget their passwords if you make them choose weird ones. Anyway now the design changed again and i am trying to pay for my Skype to Phone credit since its almost on 0. But guess what? I cannot find it. I am switching between the microsoft account and the skype account and i cannot find where to make the payment t. I only see the ret arded option to add 5 USD via auto recharge. But thats not what i want. Seriously guys, what a major fuckup. Totally lost my patience. I already thought that maybe i am just to stupid but then i check the reviews here and everybody has the same problems. Microsoft this is so sad. I was using your software since i was a child. Playing Fifa 98 on my Windows computer and so on. Everybody at my company already switched to Apple but I was like no I am used to Windows and i love it. But after today i am done with you Microsoft.

Skype,2019-03-16,1,My exerience with skype is terrible. I had 2 skype accounts and skype deducted 10 Euro every month since 2017. As I cannot log into my old account I was not able to stopp the payments. The customer service was terrible. After nearly 2 hours on the chatline - eventually they said that they would stop my payments. I am still not able to log into this old account despite giving them all information. (Payments transaction numbers etc. I have lost a lot of money and will probably never see it again. I will not use Skype anymore as it is really a scam. They prey on vulnerable  people and make is so difficult to deal with. It took many times before I managed to get a customer chat person. Did not work on my PC.  Kept saying there is an error etc. All types of excuses and technical issues. . Stay away from Skype is my advice to anybody. I am using Tesco now. Calls are only 1 cent / minute for Germany and many other countries. I hope skype will stopp clearing out my bank account. Not sure what else to do.
Skype,2019-03-16,1,"Absolutely atrocious. Microsoft bought up a serious communication tool and replaced it with a social media app for kids. When I say ""replaced"", I mean replaced. Skype 8 isn't a new version of the same program, it's a new, crappy chat app that steals the Skype brand, and they've killed the original Skype we knew and loved.What makes it truly unusable for a purpose for which I've been using it for years is that I need to be able to access old chat history in an organized manner, but Microsoft has simultaneously taken away local storage, placed a time limit on the history, taken away the ability to ""jump back"" to earlier times, and made it impossible to copy more than a couple of screenfuls at a time. Also, small amount you can copy no longer comes out in an organized fashion with bracketed time/date stamps at the beginning of each message. The copied/pasted text doesn't show dates, and is messy and hard to read. At the same time they've taken this away, they've also taken away the ability to export chat history.So they've basically limited it to real time chat and SCREWED everyone who was relying on it for record keeping. Sure, we can find other programs, but we chose Skype because of the features that it had, and now we lose data continuity because of Microsoft's arrogance and callousness.There is absolutely no excuse for treating users like this. Microsoft clearly doesn't care how disruptive it is to people's lives to take away features by the boatload and force unnecessary changes down people's throats in programs that they RELY on. It's not ""an inconvenience"", as their reps patronizingly call it, it has a real impact on important aspects of people's lives. This is not only making me abandon Skype and convince other people to abandon it, it makes me mistrust Microsoft's brand by showing that they can't be relied on to maintain a consistent feature set and they bully their users.I didn't even need them to continue developing and improving Skype Classic, I just needed them to continue patching any new security issues and otherwise leave it the hell alone. Even that was apparently too much to ask!STAY AWAY FROM SKYPE AND AVOID MICROSOFT SOFTWARE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU!Now excuse me while I go and do something I should have done a long time ago...install Linux on my primary computer. And this is coming from someone with an MCSE certification."
Skype,2019-03-16,1,"I was kind of okay with having to downgrade once Skype 8 was rolled out, Skype 8 is utter garbage and is missing core functions and feels dumbed down in very unintuitive ways, what a waste of energy and money to make something NOBODY WANTS, you have improved nothing and nobody appreciates what you have done here Micro$oft, how do you not get it, do you even read these reviews?Now i get a message that i cannot use skype unless i update it to the new horrible sh!tshow, and as i dislike being shovel fed by people who think they know whats best for me even when me and many others don't agree, not allowing me choice in the matter i am going to stop using the application, Microsoft is seriously out of touch.The original dev team must be so sad."
Skype,2019-03-12,1,"Das Neue Skype ist frustrierend. Wirklich demotivierend damit zu arbeiten. Keine Fenster, die sich abdocken lassen! Permanent schließe ich das Hauptfenster ausversehen weil irgendein bescheidenes Bild beispielsweise auf die volle Fensterbreite gezoomt wird. Dann klickt man das Fenster weg und hat den Mist wieder komplett geschlossen und darf Skype neu starten... oft merke ich es nicht und nach 3 Stunden ohne dass jemand schreibt fällt mir dann auf dass diese unfruchtbar schlecht entwickelte Version dann wieder geschlossen war. Für mich ein Beispiel dass Softwareentwicklung voll nach hinten los gehen kann... alle wollen immer updaten, der UPDATEWARN ist ausgebrochen... dabei sind viele alte ursprünglichen Versionen besser. Die Entwickler mögen schmunzeln, da denen es egal ist solange das Gehalt gezahlt wird... leider gab es auch einmal jemanden, der Skype mit liebe entwickelt hat und dem Ziel eine mächtig Nutzerfreundliche Unterhaltungsplattform zu schaffen!! Wenn dieser Perfektionist geht oder Skype verkauft wurde und ohne diese Leidenschaft weiterentwickelt wird, ist es ein Armutszeugnis für die Firma, die es weitergepflegt hat... bzw. Microsoft die es kaputtgepflegt haben. Den Praktikant, der sich hier ausglebt hat würde ich hinter Gittern bringen so viele Leute darunter leiden, die wirklich Spaß an der Software hatten. Das Zwangsupdate führt sich wie eine aufgezwungene Misshandlung meines PCs an. Schlimm das sowas erlaubt ist,... ich möchte entscheiden können welche Software ich auf meinem PC habe egal ob Microsoft die 10 Jahre später gekauft hat... ich habe die kostenlose Version und möchte diese behalten. Von Microsoft möchte ich diesbezüglich nichts wissen und spüren. Schlimm genug, dass die mir schon WINDOWS 10 aufgebrummt haben. So viel Zeit und Ärger... Und für was?

Now, it is buggy, complicated, and in all aspects, AWFUL.I mostly used it for the fact that you can video call and share screens, and unfortunately, I can’t find any other app that runs the way the old skype did. I am so aggravated with Microsoft.It is the worst application I have ever come across and I am severely disappointed in Skype."
Skype,2019-04-14,N/A,skype er ubrugeligt tager alt lyd fra dit spil og indstilingerne er ubrugelige og grim ui.
Skype,2019-03-08,N/A,"Früher (alias als Classic bekannt mittlerweile) war Skype echt toll. Aber mittlerweile, unbrauchbar und dann der Zwang. Erst sagen sie, sie belassen das Classic Skype, dann wird dies doch eingestellt und zum Hohn sagen sie einem dann, das man das web.Skye nutzen soll und was passiert da dann? Ja genau, sie stellen dies auch ein und das neue Web.Skype geht nur auf Edge oder Chrome.Meine Bekannten und Freunde, sind nun auch von Skype weg, also für mich nun auch kein Grund mehr zu bleiben, leider.Früher brauchte es kaum Ressourcen, und nun mit dem neuen Design, das komplett Unübersichtlich ist, tja, da läuft es eh nicht mehr neben einem Spiel.Und das dann manche Nachrichten, gar nicht angezeigt werden und dies wo diese Fehler nun über ein Jahr bekannt sind, sagt doch auch mit aus, wie sehr MircoDoof Skype mit am Herzen liegt, oder was es von den Usern-Wünschen mit hält. Damals die Beta zu Skype 8, war schon mehr als Fragwürdig und wurde trotz massiger Kritik umgesetzt, leider hat sich seid dem, kaum was getan. Somit ist es nicht mal mehr einen Stern, was Skype bekommen dürfte.P.S.: Seid gut einer Woche (die Zeit wo ich nun das neue Web.Skype nutze) kommen Nachrichten erst bis zu 2 Tage später an. Und mir wird oft auch gar nicht angezeigt, das mir wer eine Nachricht schickt. Weder auf dem Handy noch beim Browser/Web Skype. Skype wird immer mehr zu einer Lachnummer, leider ist dies aber nicht lustig."
Skype,2019-03-05,N/A,"How awful is the new Skype?I cannot count the ways.Old version worked beautifully Whenever I was running low in my ""wallet,"" I simply topped up and carried on as usual. Now I have to ""Subscribe.""Internal applications have been moved all over the place in counterintuitive ways.If I ran my business with the tone deafness and utter arrogance of Microsoft, I would be out of business within a week.Millions of users have complained on message boards, and the response of the M$ moderators is to say, ""Your concerns have been noted,"" and promptly lock the thread.I used ooVoo for other users with ooVoo and found it worked incredibly well for users for all over the world, and Skype for international calls for people not on the app.Remember King Midas? Everything he touched turned to gold. Well, think of Microsoft as the mirror image of King Midas. Everything it lays its hands on turns to, well, do the math, dear reader, do the math."

Skype,2019-03-03,1,"Garbage. Always runs on background, no option to shut down completely since it decides for you to minimise and ""eat"" your computer's memory, just in case someone calls you. (truth is it simply datamines). Heavy app, hugh RAM/CPU consumption"
Skype,2019-03-03,1,"What a garbage this new version is!! Dont get new message notifications, no option to change the sounds,  people not in my contact list ( not added yet  or already taken off) can still contact me through text .Garbage!"
Skype,2019-03-02,1,"Dump the Skype CRAP and use Whatsapp - a wonderfully intuitive, easy yet powerful product! An end of nightmare!"
Skype,2019-03-01,N/A,I have used Skype since it first came out 20 odd years ago. I always loved it for its simplicity. But since Microsoft took over it has gotten progressively stupidER and UgliER and more difficult to use. Until now it is practically impossible to use. It is by far the Number ONE worst piece of s..t software EVER. From someone who once thought it was the BEST EVER
Skype,2019-03-01,1,"Absolutely horrible. Microsoft finally decided to force an update to Skype despite just about every reviewer on the web pointing out just how bad the new Skype is, and how much of a step backwards it isThe interface and overall user experience is just horrid.Oh, and it is buggy too.Just let us upgrade to the old version; It was better in just about every way imaginable."
Skype,2019-03-01,1,"New Skype is horrible. UX/UI, speed, everything else deserves 0 stars. Fire all people they were working on new version and bring back the old one. Personally I would be really ashamed to work on this trash."
Skype,2019-02-21,N/A,Horrible. The UI is a joke. The need to constantly update or it won't work. It is annoying. Whoever is in charge should be straight away fired. Horrible
Skype,2019-02-21,1,"I've used this product for several years and was a big fan. Spent an hour trying to get this upgrade to work, finally walked away - piece of Sh...!."

Skype,2019-02-14,N/A,trash update. will never use skype again
Skype,2019-02-11,1,"Today I was forced to upgrade from Skype V7.4 which was the best version to date. Version 8 is a total nightmare where they have taken away the ability to have your contacts and chat window panes as two seperate windows. Now these are combined where you can only view one or the other! Added to this, a lot of the menus have been removed to make Skype (as they say) more user friendly. I personally believe this is untrue and just an excuse by Microsoft to limit what we can and can't do. Having been a Skype user for many, many years, I have now uninstalled the software and am moving to another product that actually listens to customers and understands their wants or needs. Reading a multitude of threads, Version 8 of Skype is vastly unpopular and Microsoft seem oblivious to this."
Skype,2019-02-11,N/A,"my god the new update is a mess!!!!lots and lots of bugs, like endlessit gets stuck, it's just not working that good.and the features.... guys, please just make an effort!"

Skype,2019-02-02,1,Forced to update this. Really bad in every way.

What is wrong with developers and management today...?
Skype,2019-02-01,1,"I was using Skype 7 (Classic) and had resisted updating, but this morning no choice and the update was ""forced"" on me-something I am really angry about. Instead of something that was simple, functional and reliable and helped my business, I have something that a teenager might use. Horrible interface, unable to use easily and way to easy to accidentally send emojis etc. Copying a conversation to quote to somebody else used to be a breeze, but now its a chore. Why oh why Microsoft have you imposed this monstrosity on people who (judging by the overwhelming reviews on here) simply don't want it??"

Skype,2019-01-30,1,"The worst ever update, basically they pushing you very hard to update you, MUST update otherwise you can't use the application. It doesn't matter your opinion whether you want or you dont want to upgrade. I will stop using skype."
Skype,2019-03-30,1,"Having been advised I needed to seek a refund of my Skype Credits or to reactivate them, I followed the instructions - which didn't exist.I then tried contacting support - and there was no email. So a 30 second task became about 40 minutes before giving up.Next day, 20 minutes in, and I surrendered and tried the customer services ""chat"" again.An hour later, and the assistant had achieved nothing, but to advise me that in August last year, they were going to refund my credits, but didn't. I never managed to deal with his supervisor, as I was running late for a meeting.Before I left I asked for them to contact me via email, with confirmation the refund would be forthcoming immediately, as to refuse now - c. 5 months after they said it would be provided was not legal, and that should I sue, they would lose, and additional compensation would be due - as well as the additional costs.I haven't heard anything, so I am guessing Skype prefer to be sued than honour their legal obligations.======3 months later, and the UK CEO of  Microsoft has failed to reply to a message; the CEO of Microsoft has failed to reply to numerous emails; the Head of UK Legal Services was sent a letter (yes, that was the only option) which was also ignored.Maybe 6 days a week, Microsoft close my case without doing anything, thinking that is the ""right"" thing to do, so I write back explaining that the ONLY outcome will be for reimbursement, as they committed to it, plus compensation, which merely increases as the bullying, delays and harassment increase.Soon, lawyers will be employed, which will substantially increase their costs."
Skype,2019-01-30,2,"Skype used to be awesome. I remember the look in my father's eyes when he showed it to me, back when it came out. ""One day, everybody will call each other like this,"" He said. He was almost right, right until some update changed everything. Now, it is crap. The GUI is confusing, constricting, unclear. The software is slow and crashes a lot. I always resent when I have to use it, and I'm unfailingly boiling with rage over the software's F-ups by the time we get the call to work (usually 1 hour after schedule). This is one hell of a sad story."

Skype,2019-01-29,N/A,Why to force me to upgrade to Skype 8 on my cell phone? What's the point to force users to use lame Skype 8? Skype 8 is completely rubbish!
Skype,2019-01-29,N/A,Good apps but sometime crash on my windows os. Keep update. Thanks!
Skype,2019-01-28,2,Skype has been outclassed by newer calling software.
Skype,2019-01-28,N/A,Was forced into updating to the new version which faggen sucks lol
Skype,2019-01-28,1,Skype 8 lacking plenty of the features available with Skype 7. Complete development of a new version instead of trying to force users of a perfectly fine version to use that crippled web app called Skype 8...
Skype,2019-01-28,1,The new version does not suit my needs. Will go elsewhere.
Skype,2019-01-28,1,"Microsoft transformed Skype into a garbage app.I installed classic Skype 7 long time go and had to decline updates every time it asked (There was an option to turn off updates, but MS removed it at some moment), but now it's over - Update or Quit. Shame on you Microsoft, you killed a good messenger."
Skype,2019-01-28,1,Lousy system - used to use skype as our chosen supplier interface. Now looking for an alternative. Too much screen used for no benefit. Have been reloading the older version for ages - now not allowed too.
Skype,2019-01-27,1,"Skype 8 is an atrocious redesign cutting down on all useful features Skype had before, being forced on all users now without a possibility to use the classic Skype."
Skype,2019-01-25,N/A,If I could give negative stars I would. Since the upgrade to V8 on PC the presence status is useless. I have no idea when my contacts are online and available for a call and I presume them the same with me. Also Microsoft have an annoying habit on their forums of posting updates and engaging for while on reported issues (such as this) but then lock the thread after a few months but before implementation of fixes/changes they have indicated will be made leaving you wondering if the fix is delayed or abandoned or they just don't care anymore.
Skype,2019-01-25,1,"Skype used to be a simple, effective, user-friendly app. EVERYTHING about the new Skype is bad. All the useful features have been removed. The new version is klutzy - e.g. several clicks to delete chats one by one!?? Very difficult to do anything. Nothing is intuitive. What happened to the useful symbol 'away'? Now I can only put 'invisible'. I used 'away' when I wanted to talk to just one person.  When I call skype to skype, there is an annoying beating heart symbol at the bottom of the video screen. Very irritating. When I was forced to upgrade (downgrade, actually), names of old contacts I had removed years ago appeared in my contacts list. I can find no way to remove them - only block them. My contacts list gets cluttered with a list of conversations I've made, and I can only remove those one by one. I could go on indefinitely about the bad features. What kind of morons designed this new version?! I will be migrating from skype as soon as I find an intelligent replacement."
Skype,2019-01-25,N/A,"Since I was forced to change to Version 8 I have hardly used Skype. In fact I find it pretty well unusable except for phoning landlines. I find the wave feature childish and irritating, and I would turn it off if I could. Skype used to be a great product. Such a shame!"
Skype,2019-01-24,1,"Ever sense Microsoft has purchased Skype the service has gootten worse, the new desktop app is less reliable, they took away all of abilities to save conversations or not, I don't appreciate  the data mining they are doing and reading my conversations. Microsoft really doesn't care about the user anymore. This co-insides with the view on Windows 10."
Skype,2019-01-24,1,"Why does every version of skype keep getting worse.  ifi wanted facebook messenger id use that.  So long skype, ill be finding an alternative until they come to their senses."
Skype,2019-01-23,N/A,"If I wanted to use a version of Facebook Messenger, I would, but I don't.  Ever since Microsoft purchased Skype you guys have been shooting yourselves in the foot, over and over. MS bought Skype, then merged it with Microsoft Messenger, and they killed that off. That was bad enough, as I used to keep those to lists of people separate for a reason. Then came the idiotic updates that stripped features and controls away from the user. Switch off automatic updates even though what you're using is working flawlessly?  Oh hell no! Trying to use the excuse of security?  Nope, it's not Microsoft's or Skype's job to keep MY computer safe. That's my job. I don't need a nanny.But this latest stunt of shutting down Skype, and being FORCED to update with this silly popup saying ""You haven't updated in a long time"" or else.  Really?  I checked via certain programs and v7x and v8x both access the same servers/relays, so it can't be you're 'retiring' it because of that.  So KNOCK THE CRAP OFF!  I didn't update in a long time because what I had worked fine!  So, leave off the forced updating, or revamp that tacky, obnoxious, loathsome Facebook Messenger Wanna be GUI and give us the option to have a ""Classic"" GUI, or there will still be thousands of formums with thousands (if not more) readers per forums, finding and using ways to bypass your bullying tactics."

Skype,2019-01-22,N/A,"Looks like Microsoft hasn't learned from theirs Windows 8 history. They have ruined the Skype with upgrade to ver 8, and couldn't fix this during the whole YEAR of bug fixing and ""enhancements"". This is soo sad , and makes me so angry ..."
Skype,2023-06-23,N/A,"Skype 8 is a dreadful redesign of an application that in previous versions basically worked although it was never the same once Microsoft took it over.To say it has been dumbed down would be an understatement. Many things that used to work no longer do. Where is my chat history going back years? Why is searching within chat windows useless? Why does hovering emojis not show the shortcut anymore? Why does pasting an image into a chat window immediately deliver it without the failsafe need to press Enter first?An utterly appalling application that will hopefully be resigned to the scrap heap in the next few years as tools such as the infinitely superior Slack gain more traction.Update 2023: Correction, *second* worst software application I have ever used. Microshaft have outdone themselves with Teams! What a pile of crud that is!"
Skype,2019-01-20,1,"New Skype is Who Microsoft is today...they hire programmers from all over the world and turn the company over to them. Everybody knows Programmers no nothing about what Users want....There is No chance any serious Customer/Consumer input was sought or used in making these changes and this is what you get from people who don't even use the Software they produce. Smart companies would allow you to keep the old version, but Microsoft only listens to Voices that want new ones...No doubt any New they get will be a Net Loss. Big"
Skype,2019-01-20,1,"Both thumbs down for version 8. Microsoft writes that the new version has all features from version 7 ..... the truth is that almost none of the important features are there.Compared to version 7, version 8 is a nightmare that Microsoft now forces millions of users to install if they will continue to use skype."

Para mi la mejor era la versión 7.40Ahora en la ventana donde aparece mi amigo está llena de iconos que molestan, ni siquiera hay una opción para ocultarlos. No se para qué tantas actualizaciones si estaba bien como estaba.La verdad que echo de menos el msn. Ese si que molaba."
Skype,2019-01-19,1,"I have used Skype since 2004~2005 and never had a need for an alternative but, then Microsoft stepped in. Ever since then the quality and usability just kept going down hill, never ending troubleshooting. The few better features of Skype aren't worth the trouble, plenty of alternatives. I have been considering alternatives for a while and Skype 8 finally gave me the reason to move to something else. The forced update refused to work for me, couldn't get past the log in screen, was stuck on never ending load screen. With all the troubleshooting i had to do with Skype in the past year i just didn't bother anymore. ""Good job"" MS team responsible for Skype. They took something that was working fine and destroyed it. With Skype classic dead, Skype is dead. From the comments it seems its not just me, but quite a few average Skype users."
Skype,2019-01-19,1,Call us overprotective but.... fork yourself ?
Skype,2019-01-19,N/A,Absolute rubbish.  And being FORCED to use it is unacceptable.  I have already cancelled my subscription.Cant find an 'away' status for contacts - only green online and nothing else.  I want to know if my contacts are online and away so i can send them a message and at least have the knowledge that they may see it soon before logging off.  Why make something that was good and very user friendly to a version that has important functions removed.  Surely you should be adding - not subtracting!Totally disgusted!
Skype,2019-01-18,1,"One of the worst programmes I have ever had. Skype couple years ago use to be a simple tool for calling and they were good at it! Now its slow, not working, complicated, unreliable, integrated system that I recommend not to use. The invoicing system? Ridiculous. If you wanna contact somebody? You cannot, you only get automated messages... Once my license is done, I erase, delete, ban skype from my PC and life.btw. world unlimited calling to 63 destinations is pure lie as you can only call to 8 mobile lines."
Skype,2019-01-18,1,"I rarely even register anywhere to make reviews but i am devastated by the stupidity of the team that approved such a version to reach LIVE in 21st century. This version is worse than Skype 1.0 and i am not exaggerating. And now to the details:- It is obvious that you have just merged the so called Lite version with the desktop one. The target group of Skype is people between 30 and 40 - this version is for teenagers that do not play around with the chat splits and resizable chat boxes.- Alt+Tab between the different chats on two screens was making Skype the only usable chat software up until now.- You have removed the resizing of the reply section, why? Because you removed the chat splits of course...- The update itself - is your product manager from North Korea? I haven't seen such a MUST-INSTALL-OR-I-WILL-CLOSE-THE- PROGRAM update since 2003. Not to mention the animated actors greeting me for successfully obeying to the ORDER of installing this  downgrade of Skype - all are from different colors except for the white guy who, according to Skype, is handicapped???- The only positive thing is that you have actually realized that even in non-splitable chats you are wasting my time by making me click on the reply SECTION in order for skype to allow me to start typing. This was relevant for your previous version - now it is fixed and the cursor is there blinking once you change the names - WOW, enormous update!Seriously at least allow your users to downgrade to previous versions. I assume you have migrated skype to a completely new architecture and this is quite impossible but before doing that your team must have studied the most used features of your program. This version is making everyone work slower than before."
Skype,2019-01-18,1,"Skype 8 is just plain horrid, what kind of trash is this?- No resizable chat text windows anymore? are you serious? i cant type on this tiny text bar, totally unacceptable!- No split chat windows- desktop version looks and feels like some web /mobile phone chat messenger, if i wanted to use a phone like software, then guess what we would do it.- No more multiple instances possible, i have more than one username, so why restrict it in all aspects..- only preset font sizes? why not allow users to choose their desired font size in numbers, no idea why skype tries to think for the user.- forced update? i hate when companies force update their (unfinished) softwares, im currently deciding on an alternative, one thing for certain i will not use skype 8 that is for very sure.bring back skype classic 7.41 it was all good with it, it wasnt broken so do not fix it."
Skype,2019-01-17,1,"The new version (8.x) of Skype is terrible.  Version 7.x was great, however everyone WAS FORCED to ""upgrade"" to version 8.x that lacks many features of version 7!!!!!!"
Skype,2019-01-17,N/A,Sucks! Was forced to update from a version I liked. The new version doesn't have split screen. Their solution was to tell us to use the Windows 10 version from the store. That one does have split screen but overall it is even worse. They don't listen to their users at all! Need to find something else to use.
Skype,2019-01-17,1,"Was forced to upgrade to the new skype, absolutely terrible layout"
Skype,2019-01-17,1,"Skype once my favorite chat program ... no rendered to being useless!Today I got finally forced to upgrade from my Skype Classic. I had fended off the obnoxious upgrade messages for many months, because I knew that there wouldn't be split windows for multiple conversations any more with the new skype version  (that's why I had converted back to classic many months ago). Skype was a good program, then MS bought it and every since then there's only crap and problems with it. Just an example: in the Android Skype App (on my S8 Samsung) MS has still not managed to provide me with notifications for incoming skype messages (long lists of discussions about this on the internet as well). What good is a messenger for, that does not inform you of new things. Just one of many issues to wonder about, what BS are these MS developers creating?"
Skype,2019-01-17,N/A,Skype 8 is as bad as ever...  took a full featured product and stripped it down to nothing.  Will be looking for another platform.

Skype,2019-01-16,5,a Great software for communication helps in chatting calling video conferencing makes the tasks easy
Skype,2019-01-16,1,"Not repeating what is missing in the 'new and enhanced' version, because it is just about everything everyone used. No-one wanted anything what they dumped in this 'new and enhanced' version, the one they created because the team 'listened to the customer' - ahum.I have never been complaining about a 'free' app and some bugs that came with it, BUT ... at some point MS started to integrate it as a Metro App in Win8, which was unusable, so you had to remove it and install the Desktop version (7), NOT 8! The bug was the Skype team, not the program!Then the updates came ... customers (non-IT) starting to call for support as they were lost in the 'enhanced' interface. Solution, uninstall and reinstall the Classic 7 version and, NEVER update!So far so good. Now, about 2 years later, some kids at MS developed a mobile targeted version, removing all great functionality Skype contained. Some manager must have found that this was a great idea, not to hurt their feelings I suppose, and MS decide to shove in our throats, whether we wanted or not. And now, we don't even have a choice anymore at all...Desktop Skype is ignored as if everyone is doing work on a smart phone or tablet! There are MILLIONS of Windows 10 and other PCs out there, used by people who do real work, and have real communications, all day long, every single day. And all that happened while MS is still claiming today they 'listened' to the users, yeah right...The new, young, brainless generation does not use Skype! But still, that is what MS aims for!Professionals, who build their communication with their customers around Skype are being totally ignored. Those are also the ONLY ones who actually did not mind paying for Skype Credit or get a personalized phone number.A lot of use are also losing business because of the way we communicated, customers switched and we do not always know to what if they don't tell us!So, thank you very much to the young generation, who just made sure they will NOT have a job anymore in a while, all for the sake of being 'modern' ...I fear Skype will just be left to die... Meanwhile, all Skype users are switching to something else, most to WhatsApp, and will never come back, smart move MS!"
Skype,2019-01-16,N/A,"Seit MS Skype übernommen hat, kann ich nur noch Verschlechterung feststellen. Mehr noch, sobald ein Kunde mich bittet ihn über Skype anzurufen oder ankündigt mich über Skype zu kontaktieren, bekomme ich nur noch Bauchschmerzen. Ja, so weit ist es, dass in mir sich eine Abneigung gegen dieses Programm gebildet hat, wie gegen kein anderes. Werde nun intensiv daran arbeiten den Betrieb von Skype zu befreien. ES REICHT!"
Skype,2019-01-16,N/A,"None of the features old skype had, really terrible and unusable. And the worst is, I can't use old skype anymore as I am forced to install this crap piece of software.

Skype,2019-01-15,1,"The new version 8.xx is complete crap: awful user iterface, lack of customizations available in the classic edition, slow & unstable.How Microsoft own product can break Windows design rules by putting ""close"" button on top LEFT corner of windows? Who invented the ugly controls? Shame! Shame! Shame!After I finish my already purchesed Skype credits I uninstall and don't return."

Skype,2019-01-15,1,"New Skype is absolutely shocking. Slow, full of bugs, all changes completely needless and have brought with them so many issues you have to ask yourself what are MS doing - do they not listen to feedback at all? Was finally FORCED to upgrade after staying on Skype 7 as long as possible (was cut off mid call and forced to upgrade). In the months since the new version's released Microsoft has done absolutely nothing to improve the product despite all the feedback from their loyal customers and still forces everyone to use this new garbage. Shame on you MS - if you wanted to create a new IM service aimed at kids, why didn't you do this and let the rest of us continue using an perfectly fine and serviceable product."
Skype,2019-01-15,N/A,"Unfortunately I can't give zero stars.  Forced to upgrade today and feels like I am 15 years in the past.  The new version just isn't functional.  Usability is shot, layout is awful and features are missing.  Uninstalling and cancelling my Skype number.  Avoid at all costs."

Das tat ich und mit dem heutigen Einloggversuch kam die Meldung, verkürzt gesagt, nur noch das neue ist nutzbar oder keins mehr.Sagen Sie mal, wer immer bei Skype verantwortlich für Kundenzufriedenheit  ist, interessiert Sie die Meinung der User, für die Sie ja  entwickeln, wirklich überhaupt nicht?ich bin ja schon froh, bis gestern noch das bewährte Skype gehabt zu haben und ich hatte  die Hoffnung, daß  es parallel zu dieser völlig inakzeptablen ""Version"" beibehalten würde. Irren ist menschlich...ich brachte in meinem post vom 30.08.2018 das Beispiel Yahoo messenger. und nun lesen Sie mal die Reaktionen Ihrer Kunden auf das, was Sie verzapft haben.Wenn  es  schon das ""neue (so neu ist  es ja nun nicht mehr) sein muß, dann  schalten Sie wenigstens wieder, von mir aus auch ohne support, das bewährte Skype wieder frei, für all jene, deren Meinung sie geflissentlich ignorieren und  die Skype grundsätzlich zu schätzen wissen.

Skype,2019-01-14,1,"Absolutely horrible. Skype lags all of the time, and also kills my broadband connection whenever a video call comes in. I only know of an incoming call when it fails. Using the search field crashes the app half the time, and the other half it's so painfully slow it's not worth using. The new UI is horrible. This app has failed fantastically on so many levels I wonder if Microsoft is just secretly wanting to kill this business area for themselves by making the program such a complete PITA to use. It's really difficult to fail this thoroughly without trying."
Skype,2019-01-11,1,"There are so many things wrong with this redesign, many of which earlier reviewers have mentioned.  Change for the sake of change - I suppose someone needed to justify their over-blown salary.  Like many, I will be leaving skype once I have identified a better replacement.

Firstly they removed the ability to separate chat windows. The previous option to split worked just fine for over a decade so no idea why they got clever there.Now if you wanted the split screen you have to download the windows 10 app.. now this version no longer allows you to minimise the app to the system tray. Although it runs perpetually in the background.Honestly I have no idea why they y we used to break something that worked just fine but I guess this is how devs stay in business.From my perspective, I think I'm done with Skype. WhatsApp provide a better pc/web version than Skype and I have now migrated across to there.

I did that two years ago with a phone number. Last month that number was deactivated. I simply wanted to change the number. In order to access my account Microsoft sent security codes to the deactivated number. Morons. So, I go to chat and they confirm my identity but tell me it will be 30 days until they contact me about my security information. Out of frustration I chose to close the account and create a new one. They could not close the account. The rep gave me two options. He said I could contact the phone company and have the number reactivated to they could send the code or to just not use the account for one year and then it would be deleted. Unbelievable. All because my phone number changed. Microsoft has no good system in place to deal with a changed phone number. The platform is slow, stupid, time consuming and extremely frustrating."

Finally I was so fed up I found a number to call Microsoft who bought skype and they took me round and round too and in addition were incredibily rude, didn't listen, talked over me and generally really unpleasant to deal with then finally told me they'd only work with me through the chat whom I explained were not able to help me and I wasn't dealing with anymore after several days of getting no where using chat support. Totally stupid/time wasting situation.. Honestly, all they needed to do was cancel my transaction and/or take my card manually (which I am not able to do on my end).

Bitte schön, hab ich. Doch jezt das Design und die Funktionen in einem so zu verhunzen ist schon echt ne Leistung. Über Design lässt sich ja noch streiten, aber bei den Funktionen und Einstellungen???Wer brauch schon eine Übersichtliche Liste? Bei Skype wohl niemand, riesen große Bildchen müssen sein und viel Abstand dazwischen, so das noch 6-7 Kontakte angezeigt werden. Wer Online ist muß auch nicht auf den ersten Blick zu sehen sein, bzw. zwar ist die Ansicht einstellbar, aber nach jedem Neustart wieder zurück gesetzt. Mit mehreren Leuten schreiben??? Ich hab noch nicht rausgefunden wie ich mehrere Chat´s gleichzeitig offen halten kann, statt dessen immer schön im selben Fenster vor und zurück springen, wenn ich Skype nicht in nem breiten Fenster Anzeige. Ansonsten, in der tollen Kontaktliste wo ich mich durch scrollen kann, immer schön suchen, ganz toll. Nen extra Chatfenster mit nem Doppelklick öffnen brauch halt auch niemand mehr.Optionen werden schlicht auch überbewertet, bitte wähle dein Design, gib doch bitte dein Geburtstag ein, hey hinterlass uns noch wie du bezahlen willst, oder ob im chatverlauf große Emote Icon´s angezeigt werden sollen... alles nur unwichtiger Müll.Optionen die diese Version annähernd benutzbar mache, sprich das ich z.B. eine Listenansicht habe, Chats in einem extra Fenster, Personen zur Konferenz hinzufügen mit nem einfach rechtsklick etc. alles Fehlanzeige.Ich bin seid dieser Zwangsversion endgültig raus."

Can work other way around as well.Seriously, the level of pure stupidity behind that company decision is beyond the comprehension of any sane person.Next time you decide to screw us over before purchasing and taking over another of our favorite programs, please for the love of God consider donating those billion of dollars to some good cause.

As a result I try signing in with the same number and it says ""account doesn't exist""!I try to remove my mobile number entirely form their records so I can ""start again"". However, it doesn't let you remove a number without signing in, which I can't do because I don't have an account!Next I try signing in with my email address (which is a personal domain) and again it doesn't let me because Skype only accepts Microsoft accounts.I try looking for a customer support number I can ring so I can try and remove my mobile number from their system/records. Apparently there isn't one, meaning that I can't create an account with my mobile number or email address.Terrible experience, I would like to think that this comment will be picked up and they can take the comments on board, however, given the fact I am one of 800+ negative reviews I highly doubt this."

You're in a serious or difficult conversation and the inappropriate smilie is there every message.And those are just the most excruciating issues. Get a grip MS."
Skype,2018-09-19,2,"I have been using Skype for years, which has grown to become a cornerstone for my work. Skype 8 killed all of that with one well-aimed blow. Where to start? Essential features are still missing (advanced status control, multiple chat windows, adding phone numbers to contacts, compact view, searching within messages, etc). I find the user interface downright ugly, with bizarre colors and sounds, and is confusing to navigate. Hey, the interface does not even follow Microsoft's own guidelines for the equally ugly UWP system.  Last, Skype has gained stupid features such as highlights and stickers - STICKERS?! - in order to copy other chat tools.There are some positive new features, such as the media gallery, but this is only really needed if you somehow fail to organize downloaded data on your computer.Skype used to stand out for its sleek, simple, and elegant experience. Now it has been reduced to look like one of many, at the cost of essential functionality. Microsoft, what where you thinking?"

It is slow, the UI is unintuitive and half the options seem to be missing. It even lacks basic functionality such as the ability to search your conversation.People need a reliable and robust program that allows for instant messaging, calls, video calls and screen sharing. Previous version fulfilled that need most of the time. The new version fails miserably."

I was not aware how painful it can be to loose a piece of software. Software i am using for hours each day.If by chance somebody from MS reads this message, i politely ask to remove all the ""design"" from Skype and make it a real, stalwart tool & service again. People are leaving Skype in droves, migrating to other services like slack because they just can not work with it anymore.If i would be MS i would rather have invested in the screen sharing experience (like adding a mouse pointer or some interactivity) than adding useless kitsch."

Of course, now they assume you keep your phone with you all the time. Well, guess what, I can not keep my desktop with me all the time! Since I am a developer it is connected to lot of stuff and It won't fit in a backpack."

Skype,2018-09-05,N/A,New version is absolute garbageIts really annoying that having reverted to old version it keeps trying to update to the Crap version
Skype,2018-09-05,N/A,"the desktop software is actually not that bad, it works fine most of the time. But the update window is incredibly annoying, and the new version is not that good. the browser app is pretty slow and i never used the mobile app so can't say much about it.In the long run, it's an ok software to use, although needs some improvements."
Skype,2018-09-04,N/A,"Absolute garbage. Every time my iPhone receives an ""update"" it gets worse. Or it will improve and the buttons actually work until the next ""update.""

Skype,2018-08-30,N/A,"horrendous to use, stupid design, fails at nearly all connections. The original skype was awesome compared to this piece of design.Microsoft have ruined a once great program.do yourself a favour and use anything as there all better than this now."
Skype,2018-08-30,1,Not a patch on the Classic version. Devoid of options and flexibility
Skype,2018-08-28,1,"Used to use it and it was fine for a free program. Didn't use it for a couple of years. Then Microsoft bought it... *gigantic sighing sound*Heard it was now full of ads and impaired functionality. I was informed or found out that my account had been hacked or something, nice going Microsoft. Their recovery process involved me having to specify the date that I first installed skype, to the month. I couldn't remember the year that I installed it - I hadn't used it for 2 - let alone the exact month. So even though I could name all my contacts by first and last name, and email, from memory, and obviously had access to the email address I signed up for skype with and was using it for this recovery process, they wouldn't let me back in. Because I couldn't remember the exact month I first installed it.""Oh yes, now I'm likely to sign up for another account on this competent application from this competent company"" — said no one ever."

Skype,2018-08-26,N/A,"Unfortunately, zero points is not possible. SKYPE has been a staple communications and meeting application for many years, until the then labelled 'classic' version was force-replaced by something unusable. No parallel chat windows, no easy way to interact with multiple contacts, and an interface that seems to be designed as a throwback to Windows 3.1 days. How this has been rolled out and survived usability testing is beyond me, but unless this mistake is corrected, SKYPE will no longer be viable for business or personal use for me. Simple fails such as not being able to customise a view (e.g. ""online contacts"") to be persistent when switching to a conversation and back are so disruptive that I cannot recall any worse designed GUI for any software in many years."

Nej hvor jeg savner de gamle messenger dage, som var genialt. Dette her er så mange år tilbage i tiden. Grimt UI er det også. Der er ingen indstillinger som er brugbare længere. Det er netop, som en anden anmeldelse kom ind på: Nedgradering efter nedgradering! Jeg frygtede for Skypes fremtid da Microsoft overtog dem, jeg fik ret! Luk det og start forfra med en ny fantastisk Skype tak! Og sælg det gerne til et firma som kan fokusere på det. I har for meget på jeres tallerken ser det ud til."

Skype,2018-08-20,N/A,"Dreadful interface, user hostile on PC.  Presence no longer works properly."
Skype,2018-08-19,1,"This version of skype has zero customization, and the interface is ugly as sin.  This version also no longer allows for window conversations to pop out so you can only do one conversation at a time.  Honestly they are killing skype faster than they are fixing it.  This latest update is clearly a sign of a company that no longer cares about the quality of their program nor stability and usability.  Their just doing what they want and we have to scream as loud as we can at them to get them to listen.  If they had to only use their own products they would feel the same way we do, it would be hell in their offices.  I bet any of them use discord or some other app, so all in all I give this program as it is a 1 star rating.  Use skype classic if they do not threaten it's existence with a set expiry date again like whining children not getting their way.Before you try to change the program fix it and fix what is wrong then work on making it look how you want.  If you can't fix what you broke, then why bother?  Fix the contract list issues, fix the chat history issue, fix the lack of customization, fix the program and then make sure we are happy as well as YOU ARE."
Skype,2018-08-19,2,"Latest Skype version (8.28 Win10) is unbelievably bad. Can't believe Microsoft quality control is this bad. Why make program this important worse by each version? Many years ago Skype was working perfectly fine. Now contact state is unreliable, status message line is not shown, chat is sometimes broken, Skype does not remember contact list settings, etc... Ok, If you can get video chat working, then connection is satisfactory. Bu please, make Skype better!"
Skype,2018-08-19,1,It´s the worst skype version I´ve ever worked with.-In a skype call it´s almost impossible to chat with others and see all your contacts?!- searching through a specific chat...It´s not possible anymore. Now there is a global search which searchs through everything...I really don´t get it...Those are only 2 of the things which are really annoying me. I want the old version back.
Skype,2018-08-18,N/A,"Wie kann man nur.... einem Programm bzw. einer Software dies so ausgereift ist, so einen Todes Update verpassen ? Ich nur nutze skype fast täglich Und war immer für zufrieden. Nicht nur das Skype am PC jetzt aussieht wie die mobile Versionen, Sondern auch das Videobild meiner sündhaft teuren Webcam hat jetzt extremes Bildrauschen."
Skype,2018-08-16,N/A,I use Skype for work for more than 10 years .This new interface is impossible to use for me.i can't have a window per conversation anymore plus closing it kill the application instead of just minimizing as it used to.I can't afford security risk linked with downgrading to previous version so I'm actively looking for another solution.

Skype,2018-08-15,1,"The recent update is very difficult. The last version was great and really user friendly, why have you made so many changes for the worse? Bring back the old version!!!"
Skype,2018-08-14,1,"Skype used to be tele-contactable, helpful and easy to use. I think Microsoft is trying to kill it by making it as user-unfriendly and remote as possible. As a multiple stroke victim (7 in 18 months) with limited manual dexterity, typing on live chat is exhausting and difficult (made more so than necessary by the tiny window a customer has in which to explain his/her problem.  The message is clear:""GO AWAY, we're not really interested in your problems with our now-restricted service!"""
Skype,2018-08-14,1,I am sure that whoever is in charge of Skype wants to drive all the users to some other product as successive updates have made this once great program almost unusable. All of the control has gone. All the user settings are gone. All the bells and whistles that made the program great are replaced by unfriendly unhelpful screens and a generally amateurish look and feel. Way to go Microsoft!
Skype,2018-08-14,1,"The new Version is horrible - How could this have happened. Everything is completely trashy. No overview, bad design no control over any function... The whole thing feels like clicking in Hell."
Skype,2018-08-14,1,"New Skype i awful and no chance to customize. And I don't like when someone says ""you MUST install something new because we did ANOTHER version of Skype..."" That why I'm going to install Slack. Bye bye Skype."
Skype,2018-08-13,1,"The Things missing I noticed was no ability to change font size and when you block someone temporarily, they disappear from your friends list and there is no way to get them back.If this is where skype is going, all it's users will be finding other platforms.It felt bad enough when BIG BROTHER bought Skype.Now they want to make it worse?"
Skype,2018-08-13,1,"Microsoft, what are you doing? Those who launched this, don't use Skype, do they? It's a terrible version. It lacks possibility to customize it or set it up, and this on top of a very bad UI. Just few examples:- You don't go away automatically, when you are off (not even such status exists).- No more compact vs complete view. The pseudo compact view takes 1/3 of my screen + you need to click at least twice! to change the screen from one contact to another (as you need to go through the main list). - Chat notification is a complete mess. I could continue, but you got the point.Honestly, I'm giving this star, because I cannot write a review without it!"
Skype,2018-08-13,1,"this new update is like going back to 1995, totally unuseable, gave it 1 star as there are no negative stars"
Skype,2018-08-12,1,"Why have they messed around with Skype again! There is no way to add contacts to the new version,, no way to see how to make calls.  I HATE IT! What was wrong with the last version?????????"
Skype,2018-08-10,N/A,"Used to be a great app that worked perfectly, until Microsoft bought it out.Since then they 'improved it' by adding over zealous noise-cancelling which will cancel out the conversation if there is any background noise. They've added more features that no-one asked for or needed making the installer pointlessly bloated.Their support is terrible, as in non-existent. You can give feedback which is completely ignored. You can email them but they never reply.The latest update (the worst version ever) has an unnecessarily larger single all-encompassing GUI which now won't let you have more than one chat window open, or have a chat window AND your contacts viewable without expanding huge window open.Worse, if you try to install any previous version, it will claim it 'can't connect' - of course it can connect, but it's forcing you to 'update' to the new crappy 'limited use' version.If you're looking for a reliable Vid/Voice/Chat client compact minimalist GUI, it's definitely NOT Skype !!"
Skype,2018-08-09,N/A,"I am not sure why would you change something which was absolutely amazing to absolutely crap! Skype's latest version is the worst version ever and I am saying this after having been using Skype on a daily basis since 2010!The only reason why they would make it worse is to push people to get the more premium paid version of it or they may be coming up with a new product and want people to jump on to that. If this is not improved soon, Skype will be history soon!"
Skype,2018-08-08,1,"Unbelievably obnoxious and not personalized service. If you don't have a problems it works ok. However,  if for any reason you stuck,  technically or financially, you screwed. I had yearly subscription for unlimited calls. They suspected some fraud activities for whatever reason is. It took me 6 months and 4 hours of calls to remove the block of the account. Guess what, I requested to extend the subscription for 6 months that were paid for but unabled for use, they said NO. No explanation,  but ""unfortunately we won't extend and won't prorate"". Simple NO. Microsoft is obnoxious and ignorant empire, where customers worth nothing."
Skype,2018-08-08,N/A,"There was an issue with my Skype account that prevented me from gaining access. This was not a fault on my part and after several emails and calls to try and sort out the situation, Skype were still unable to grant me access. Not only did I loose my network of contacts, many of which I will not be able to find again, but I also lost over £20 of credit to which Skype refused to reimburse tor transfer to my new account. Very poor!"

Skype,2018-08-08,1,"I have been using Skype for many years. Skype 8 is just awful. However, you can reinstall Skype 7 over the new version. If you do not have the old installer, search for SkypeFullSetup.exe or skype_7.40.0.104.exe and install that. Do not upgrade again. There's a short announcement for Microsoft on a Skype support forum that the 1 September 2018 deadline no longer applies.Why is it bad? Uses huge amounts of screen space;many features of Skype Classic are missing. You cannot use a headset and have it ring on the PC speakers."
Skype,2018-08-08,1,"Dear God MS. What are you doing???Skype was a wonderful product until the last few years. The ""upgrades"" and ESPECIALLY the UI now is terrible. TERRIBLE. Why the hell don't you TEST with your loyal users BEFORE you send the product out? My whole company has used Skype for years and we almost live on the thing. But now.... we are all uniformly scrambling to find another system.You simply MUST let pro users be able to customize the UI. All the things people complain aout the new UI below are real and true. WHY WHY WHY do I have to be SUPER-CAREFUL now that I don't hit ""Enter"" or the message simply flies out to the recipient. CTRL-Enter should still be available. There are DOZENS more examples. Even the SOUNDS now are super-annoying.Please get back the Ver 7 functionality. Revert to the code that worked, PLEASE. I've used this product since the very beginning and it's a crying shame what you are doing to what was a perfectly wonderful program. I *will* change (and so will my entire company) if this does not get sorted. So, so so sad. Sigh."

Skype,2018-08-07,1,Skype 8 is a big pile of horse S**T. The UI is horrible and they have stripped off most of the customizable options. Reverting back to 7 until supported and if they don't fix this s*** will change the program with something else...
Skype,2018-08-07,1,"Only Microsoft could take a product and degrade it to such an abysmal level.Simple things, like the option to send a message using ctrl-enter instead of 'enter' have gone. Now if you want to send more than one paragraph in a message you have to remember that you cannot just hit 'enter'. Just how dim do you have to be to deprecate a very needed feature for many.The new version is inflexible with many configurable options gone. Why would anybody take away features?You can't even have chats in separate windows or control how your online presence is managed.Awful."
Skype,2018-08-07,1,"Absolut bescheiden. Die alten Versionen waren unkomplizierter und vor allem besser. Das neue Skype ist absolut bescheuert und meines Erachtens nach das Letzte. Leider wurden ältere Versionen eingestellt und sind nicht mehr nutzbar, so das man gezwungen ist, will man Skype weiter hin nutzen, die neue Version zu nehmen. Werde Skype wohl schmeißen. Da sind mir andere Messenger inzwischen viel lieber."

Before it was easy and instant to see which groups are active and actual, which users are online or away, text was easy to read for eyes. Now everything is overcomplex and filled with unnecessary text. Graphics and Colors and fonts are completely chaotic and disturbing while reading.It really seems the new microsoft era is: buying tech companies and distroy them. Same happened with ""Microsoft Phone aka Nokia"".How can you change a software in a way that i get so uggly and unpracticable that clients will not gonna use it anymore. It seems they hire outranged Google and Apple guys to make their application look modern and fancy but MS Managers are too incompetent to understand: if you hire bad people (even if they have 10 PhDs) they will completely distroy even stable working MS software. Secondly if you hire cheap fresh IT students and put them into work teams they will distroy your last working software aswell (see skype 8.X)!To the Management: How can you accept a dev. Team to change a major product in a way that is looses their entire userfriendly interface?If they are not doing a 180° turn around it seems to me its time to start alternative solutions. Im 99% sure most of the skype clients will agree on the fact MS is loosing a lot of skype users and activity if they are not able to get the 180° turn and change the software as it was at Version 7.X!"

I'm simply going to uninstall it now and use WhatsApp for video chats instead. When I make a call, the big picture (video) on my monitor is of myself - the small video image in the upper right corner is of the person I'm talking with (the opposite of how is used to be). Sometimes, the other person only sees my profile picture on their monitor (again, on the small video image on their computer), despite the fact that my video icon shows it's active. Sometimes, if I double click the image on my screen, the larger video will revert to that of the person with whom I'm speaking, as it used to be.The Skype icon no longer shows up on my taskbar when I'm not actively using the program. It took me days to find out how to get my contacts to display as they used to. I've never seen such a dramatic failure of an update!"

Skype,2018-07-29,N/A,"I've used Skype for the past ~8 years and this new update is just god awful. Old skype used to show the names and statuses of people in group chats. Now it says that there are X participants, and I have to click on it to see who's even in the group, and even in that window, it doesn't show any status update for anyone who isn't online. I want to see that people are offline/away/busy, don't lump them all into a non-existant indicator. When group video chatting, it forces you to either pick one person to focus on, or have everyone 'optimized' to fit the window. If they aren't centered to their camera you just can't see them. Why cant I have the option to see EVERYONE's FULL CAMERA, even if it would be smaller. Why can't I adjust the size of the chat box when I'm in a call?  So many useful features from the old skype have been stripped away leaving this un-customizable, frustrating-to-use shell of an app. It's like skype felt threatened by Discord's increasing popularity, tried to rush out an update and completely dropped the ball."

Skype har ikke anerkendt, at der er sket et sikkerhedsbrud hos dem og har på ingen måde forsøgt at fikse det. Jeg får stadig mails om aktivitet på min konto, som ikke er min.Så, udover at brugerfladen nu er svær at finde rundt i og er ufleksibel, risikerer man nu at finansiere samtaler fra Rusland.

They removed so many options,  and added maybe 3 new useless things.i can no longer choose the font i wanna use, no longer adjust my notification settings, no longer send 3 min. video messages, no longer change my audio settings, no longer turn off emoji'sbut oh, it's okay, you can change skype to be black nowy'know, just as a reminder that there's now a much better application you could be using, discordso many things are just bad."
Skype,2018-07-24,N/A,"From today I wil have to look for another application to keep contacts with my suppliers as this evrsion is for boys and girls, not for people that have to work on a PC handling multiple conversation at the same time. Pls revert back to version 7 until you find a solution and some mor eintelligent programmers to make it workable. This 8 version remembers me ... Windows 8 !"
Skype,2018-07-24,1,"Skype has turned to crap, pretty much like Microsoft has"
Skype,2018-07-24,N/A,It is a disaster like the Microsoft Phone. There is no split view to see the message and contacts. No search option is available & Skype get closed instead of minimizing.
Skype,2018-07-23,N/A,"Absolutely awful. No longer going to be using Skype, even though I have been using it for years. I thought my friend was exaggerating when he told me how many customization options they'd gotten rid of. I'm particularly annoyed at the notification settings, where you either have ""everything on"" or ""everything off"". I can't work with message previews popping up in the bin and sounds constantly binging, but I don't see the tiny little number fade into existence at the very bottom of the Skype icon on my computer.The lack of messaging settings, audio settings, video settings, file download settings - it's frustrating being forced into a clear downgrade. I'm using a desktop PC because I want to be on a desktop PC, please stop trying to turn your program into a mobile application.I would be fine if they allowed us to continue using the classic version like they'd told us before. But apparently they rescinded that! Back to Discord I go."
Skype,2018-07-23,1,"Latest update of skype in July 2018 is a total disaster.  It was forced on my computer by the ..... at Microsoft and has replaced a reasonable version of skype with garbage.  It is not even worth 1 star.  Some idiot has decided that making most of the text grey is a great idea.  It's not as I can't see it clearly.  Try to get your heads around this you MS morons; ""if we can't see it properly, it really is not much good to us"".The idiots have also been making up ""themes"" as if this any use at all.  You can have faded blue, burnt yellow or something else I truly do not want.  Worst of all, the downgraded the software so the webcam is now a fuzzy mess, out of focus and pretty much less, yet for other applications my webcam is clear as a bell.  Thanks so much MS for destroying skype.  Before you got your filthy hands on it Skype was brilliant.  No danger of that any longer.Meantime, I will look around for something else and I advise everyone to now do the same.  Microsoft of course will ignore all criticism because they feel they don't need to take any notice of people who use their stuff.  Well things are changing fast MS.  Your market share is down to less than 8% and the time is coming when you will be replaced by something better.  Perhaps then and only then will skype be given a new lease of life when it removed from MS."
Skype,2018-07-23,N/A,"I tried the new version of Skype several months ago, hated it and went back to the Classic version. Now I'm being forced to use the new version (from 1 September, but I've ""upgraded"" now). I still think it's terrible, but at least I've managed to regain camera control thanks to Manycam.com"
Skype,2018-07-23,2,"Why all the updates Skype why??? The onder version was fine. Now it so difficult to group my contacts. You only see who is online, not if someone is AFK but still online. I dont get the new design as well."
Skype,2018-07-23,1,"Das neue Skype für den PC ist grottenschlecht, keine eigene Audioverwaltung hinzufügen von anrufern ist sehr kompliziert, vorher konnte man einen Anrufer einfach über die Funktion - Anrufer zur Konferenz hinzufügen, das ist leider nicht mehr möglich!Liebe Programmierer von Skype! Ich benutze Skype seid über 10 Jahren und war immer zufrieden, aber jetzt ist es Grottenschlecht!LG Michael"
Skype,2018-07-23,N/A,piece of garbage worst one yet
Skype,2018-07-22,N/A,"I hate the newest update - the controls are moved around (in some cases, hidden), making it harder to navigate, for no apparent reason; and the ability to call up a contact list has been eliminated, making it much more cumbersome for me to ... well, group-call the people on my list. Even a handy feature of call notification - that is a signal that your outgoing call is being processed has been eliminated ... so you don't know if it's going through or not. There's no easy way to see who all you have in a group call ... that is, who has answered and who not (and whom you might have to call again). One of the ""improvements"" is the ability to emoji somebody with an illustration of what you feel... what!? you're on the phone (or video) ... you can't just say it? Oh ... and the new skype can't do my special (foreign language) characters like the old one does ... What's more and worse -- evidently, the old, better skype is going to be eliminated, so you don't even have the ability to stay with it."

Skype,2018-07-22,N/A,"Unacceptable experience pretty much sums it up. Having settings to manage all this crap would help somewhat, at least, but there are practically none. Did everyone at MS go full eetard?"
Skype,2018-07-22,1,"Horrible. A backwards step. They have removed many of the characteristics that made Skype great, and added new ""features"" that clutters the desktop and makes it almost unusable. I do NOT want Skype to show me all the contacts in my database."
Skype,2018-07-22,1,Terrible since update on Windows 10 Wish I had never installed it
Skype,2018-07-21,N/A,"If it was not for the message that I will not be able to use older version of skype I would not have updated biggest mistake ever made.The layout sucks, status sucks(removed some options there), cannot adjust some screen settings for it, it's just a very horrible experience, if I would not have to use it daily I would switch to another app that is much better and reliable than this. Keep us prisoners Skype!"
Skype,2018-07-21,N/A,Horrible. Stupid emoticons and music. No real influence in settings. Terrible performance. Interface is too fluid and deigned poorly.
Skype,2018-07-21,N/A,Worst update ever...I don't want phone version on pc
Skype,2018-07-21,N/A,"More of downgrade than an upgrade.Had Skype since it first came out and has always been quick easy to use and navigate.  Now it has been updated it is the biggest load of rubbish almost unusable,Why fix something that was not broken"
Skype,2018-07-21,1,Upgraded today. Very unhappy with new system. Now have 'unknown bot' in contacts page & cannot block or delete it. Skype is lifeline for older folk like us to keep in touch with far-flung family. very sad & bit scared!!
Skype,2018-07-21,N/A,"Layout is so horrible. Older one was much better. Prettier doesn't mean better.This was already gone through when you changed phone layout. Did you listen or do anything about it? No. Instead, you brought this horribleness to windows as well. What is the point of users reviews and opinions if you are not gonna listen them anyway? If your goal was to lose user and push me towards discord, then congratulations. You succeeded."
Skype,2018-07-20,1,"Cannot show full screen of contact, just has a small picture. Layout is much harder to use than the previous version."
Skype,2018-07-20,1,"It's terrible i hate the whole layout i hate how it shows my full face before i connect a call, i hate the style of it. Please why force changes that people don't want. Why fix what isn't broke. Please restore it back to original i hate hate hate it"
Skype,2018-07-19,N/A,"How did they mess up so badly??They had such a nice and simple program, and just ruined it with social integration and actively removing features while making it look more and more like Snapchat. What a failure of an app. Moving to Discord."
Skype,2018-07-19,1,"Absolute rubbish! Used to have two or three conversation window open at once and could keep track of each conversation - not possible any more as far as I can see......Sack all the wizzkids, revert to the previous version and stop TRYING to be clever - you are not inteligent enough.........."
Skype,2018-07-19,N/A,"The new version of Skype is absolutely awful. It is refusing to show full size video of people I am in contact with. Only shows tiny unchanageable little box if all other programs are minimised. The previous version worked fine, the new version is actually next to useless and as I use Skype a lot now really frustrating."
Skype,2018-07-19,1,"terrible customer support, they take your money and will not respond to any inquiries and no contact telephone support. Stay away at all cost."
Skype,2018-07-18,N/A,"Absolutely hate this garbage software, signing in is a pain, the updates are a pain and the call quality is very low. Use Discord instead please."
Skype,2018-07-18,1,"Ich kann das neue Skype leider nicht weiterempfehlen, da ich so gut wie gar nichts mehr auf einfachem Wege einstellen kann(Menüleiste fehlt komplett). Zusätzlich logt sich seit ein paar tagen ein sogenannter ""Unbekannter Bot"" einfach, ohne vorher zu fragen, ob ich damit einverstanden bin, in meine Tablet-Android-Version ein. Diesen kann ich weder öffnen, um zu sehen, wer sich dahinter verbirgt, noch kann ich ihn wieder aus den Kontakten löschen! Einen solchen Mist braucht keiner wirklich und ich kann es verstehen, wenn immer mehr Nutzer Skype den Rücken kehren. Ich werde es auch wohl tun!"
Skype,2018-07-18,1,"Been using Skype for years... unfortunately the new design is not good enough to warrant my continued use.I loved the old skype, but I see now that you can't even keep that around... so I'm taking the consequense and uninstalling. DId not believe I could leave without leaving a message about it though... so here we go...Hope that it will change at some point.@Skype why do you not listen to your users?"
Skype,2018-07-18,1,"Jeg har lige skiftet til den nyeste Skype og har i mit lange liv med computere aldrig nogensinde før oplevet så stor og alvorlig en fordummelse og overforsimpling af et program som med denne ene opdatering.- Langt de fleste indstillingsmuligheder er forsvundet.- Den ellers i næsten samtlige andre programmer så universelle mulighed for at ændre størrelsen på de forskellige vinduer er blevet fjernet, hvilket især ser idiotisk ud, når man maksimerer det nye Skype, og det enorme, næsten ubrugelige blå vindue fylder det meste af skærmen, mens det langt vigtigere tekst-chatfelt stadig er klemt sammen ude i siden.- Det er nu umuligt at samtale med folk, mens man både kan se samtalens tekst-chat og ens andre kontakter, så under en samtale skal man vælge mellem at se tekst-chatten eller kunne holde øje med, hvem der er online, og knapperne hvormed man skifter mellem de to befinder sig selvfølgelig to forskellige steder, fordi grunde.- Hver gang jeg skifter til et andet program, mens jeg samtaler på Skype, dukker der et lille, irriterende, grimt Skype-vindue op, og der er ingen funktion i indstillingerne, der nu meget sigende hedder ""appindstillinger"", der kan fjerne det lille vindue, så man skal konstant sidde og klikke det væk. Det er ekstremt anmassende, og det er for mig selveste ""deal breakeren"" der vil få mig til at opgive Skype.- Der er sikkert flere, lige så elendige nedgraderinger at føje til denne liste, men jeg har valgt at nævne dem, der umiddelbart er mest generende.Jeg er ikke i tvivl om, at der blandt Skypes udviklere og ledere befinder sig nogle endog særdeles overbetalte professionelle idioter, og det ærgrer mig, at Microsoft, i forsøget på at få flere smartphone-brugere til at bruge Skype, har valgt at fordumme og overforsimple et ellers udmærket program* i så ekstrem en grad.Én stjerne for en fuldstændig uacceptabel nedgradering.* Åh undskyld! Det hedder en ""app"" nu, ikke sandt? Suk støn."
Skype,2018-07-18,1,"Micro$oft's ignorance, arrogance and greedy incompetence continues to mark them as one of the ugliest corporations on the planet. Their destruction of Skype is one of a long list of shameful self-serving and to-hell-with-the-user acts of vandalism. Like many, I feared this day when they first got their filthy hands on Skype, as their modus operandi, that they would rape it for profit at the expense of the community, was glaringly obvious from from the outset. I avoid all their products like the plague these days and suggest others do too. Boycott Micro$oft. PS: I just tried out Google Hangouts as an alternative to Skype: it's slightly different but it works for me very well now I have got used to it."
Skype,2018-07-18,N/A,"New Skype suck. First of all it is laggy, which classic skype was never. I cannot find keywords in conversations anymore using ctrl+f, which used to be a very useful feature. When you open pictures from skype the open over the whole screen so that you cannot see the conversation anymore. If you happen to close the window by mouse you also close skype. The design is also less appealing, not as easy seeing who is online etc. I cannot see one single betterment with this update. Very, very dissapointing."
Skype,2018-07-18,N/A,What on earth.... Stop. Just stop. The previous bad update was better than this Skype 8 bullcrap! What the hell is with the camera? My video feed has NEVER looked so awful! Please just give us classic Skype back. It's the only one that ever worked right. How can I keep in touch with my family and boyfriend if the one platform we all use doesn't work!?!??! Please don't do this. Please change it back. This is ridiculous!
Skype,2018-07-17,N/A,I want Microsoft to promise me just one small thing.   Please do not consider buying an aircraft manufacturing company like Boeing or Airbus.  If you did then I would have to drive my car from the UK to Australia for my holidays instead of flying because all the aircraft would have crashed.
Skype,2018-07-17,1,"The new Skype is useless. Was asked to updated my classic Skype to a new version today and got a very different and completely useless version. First of all the window cannot be resized - so when sharing screen you see it so small that it is impossible to see anything. The video is portrait instead of landscape - and it cannot be changed. Not very useful if you use Skype for video conference with more than one person. Unfortunately, Microsoft has removed the classic Skype from the download page. :("

Now Microsoft have made it look like the work of a 6 year old kid who has never used Skype before and just wanted to fill the screen with useless garbage while disabling most of the original Skype features.

Skype,2018-07-04,1,"Once upon a time, there was an application called Skype, it was simple, clever, fast and reliable. It allowed people to chat with instant messaging and IP telephony for free and even when we wanted to call a landline it wasn't too expensive. Wakey Wakey, its 2018 now. Skype has 'improved' no end, IM's take hours to send, my Android mobile rings but my PC doesn't, even if I go to answer the call on the mobile, i cannot find the button to answer the call. You have remarkably managed to turn a shining beacon of software development into nothing more than a poo, yet you continue to 'polish' it. I'd go back and get the original code that you bought and start again."
Skype,2018-07-04,1,"Absolutely terrible upgrade.We rely on Skype for day to day business, and I'm often left waiting 30 minutes to an hour for messages to send, the mobile and desktop versions clearly work at different rates, and a series of user-friendly features (like copy and pasting chunks of conversation) have been cancelled. It seriously affects our ability to operate and we are now looking at other software to channel our comms.How does a company release a product like this and hope to retain customers? And why has it taken this long to fix these extremely obvious issues? What a waste."

Skype,2018-06-27,1,Used to be our main means of contact with relatives in Australia and New Zealand but now it's absolute rubbish. Once again the arrogance of Microsoft shines through destroying a pretty good program.
Skype,2018-06-24,1,"After many happy years on Skype, they could not verify my account into a new Microsoft system apparently.  Many hours trying to fix it, countless emails, personal phone contact, more emails, all unresolved leaving me with a useless account for no reason.  They still owe me account money for phone left behind.... never was a problem in the first place...  So,  I started a new account, it worked once with my new password, then same problem, Microsoft logo pops up and says they want to do me a favor and require another layer of identification....  I only got to use my account once, then fell into the abyss, no reason on earth for this.  I give up on Skype, sorry to see it go.. Now to close the 2nd account..."

The latest update May/June 2018 is utter rubbish, stupid layout, big text as if we are children who cant read, and sooooo sloooow!! Also, slower than ever at startup. I reverted back and the older version is a lot better. Time someone else did a service to replace this thing! I would give it -1 star if I could."
Skype,2018-06-07,1,I am really disappointed by Skype's recent performance. the desktop version is not successfully compatible with the app version. Everything is messed up and it starts sharing sound on its own. The mute button doesn't work sometimes. If one person share screens once the other cant share it so we have to cut the call and reconnect. Skype really needs to fix-up
Skype,2018-06-07,1,"The new version of Skype desktop is one of the worst software ever seen from Microsoft.Your contact lists made on your own are gone now you can see what Skype Microsoft wants youi to see.Android version is at the same level..

Skype,2018-06-06,1,"In 2018 heeft Skype dit jaar verschillende updates gehad. Het gevolg is dat vele contacten gestopt zijn met Skype. Het is letterlijk soms een gevecht om een relatie te bereiken. Ik gebruikte ook Skype OUT, maar het lijkt wel of ze hun telefoon service willen stoppen. Om die reden ben ik nu aan het experimenteren met Viber OUT. De eerste 2 gesprekken gingen vlekken loos met Viber. Het gekke is, dat Skype Business to Business wel goed schijnt te werken. Maar daar moet men voor betalen. Ik denk daarom dat 90% van de skype relaties over 6 maanden skype delete. Waarom zou men betalen als er gratis apps zijn!"
Skype,2018-06-04,N/A,"Classic change for change sake and for the worse; presumably a new generation of developers or new management feel the need to make their personal mark on this product, but it seems rather odd that MS are allowing them to turn off so many customers.Alternatively Microsoft want to trash the old name so the whole service can be re-launched and re-branded as an exciting and innovative MS product.I can visualise the marketing people in presentation ecstasy as they choose the new name for something that actually functioned very well when many of them were still at school."

I am asked to create a new login, my picture was automatically taken from Gmail instead of using my old Skype photo etc. All these updates are making Skype worse and complicated.

Skype,2018-05-15,N/A,"Classic Skype stopped working on May for multiple Win10 users including me and I was obliged to use Skype 8.  In 2 words - this version is unacceptable for work.  I have 50+ chats every day and new Search doesn't allow me to find needed chat. some chats cannot be searched at all (those with ""Name1, Name2""). Searching public directory when I just want to switch local chat is completely redundant.Dozens of missing features like Copying/quoting several messages, creating chats by multi-selecting participants of existing chat, no search inside chat, lags and crashes when searching messages history, no Ctrl+Enter sending, no hyperlinks in chat names, ... I can continue this list endlessly.Make Classic Skype work for Win 10 at least!"

I then purchased a dedicated skype number and the caller ID still doesn't work - all my calls are showing up as private. I've essentially paid $40 for the ability to listen to peoples voicemail, as not many people answer private calls. Skype also, and i guess this became a policy because of their utterly useless service, do not provide refunds for this .Oh and to top it off their support is non exsistent - they clearly have no interest in helping customers and fob pepple off to FAQ's with loops of hyperlinks,.........If you are planing to use a service to call home whilst you a abroard for more than a few days I would check out VoiP providers speciailly voipstudio. I will never use skype again for calling - utterly useless....I can only assume theyre actually trying to be this bad intentionally because they couldn't do it by accident."
Skype,2018-05-12,1,"New version is absolute rubbish. Why ""away"" status has been removed? And  how do I check if somebody is available? Not to mention big chat window without giving a user option to close it. Terrible ""upgrade"". Time to switch to something else, Messenger perhaps."
Skype,2018-05-10,N/A,Absolute rubbish App for iphone. Call quality is terrible and constantly drops. Promises to be a phone service i.e. you dial a local number but really it is using 4G / wifi data to a server in your country which then makes a Voip call overseas to a local / mobile number.Voxofon and Rebtel are far superior platforms with high call quality.Do not waste your money.Microsoft should be ashamed of this!
Skype,2018-05-07,1,Not logged into Skype for a while but when i did i found that all my contacts were gone.  My parents have been trying to use there account for a while but failed.  The UI looks crap too.  I'm going to find an alternative now once i've deleted the app from my phone.  byebye
Skype,2018-05-07,1,"Absolute rubbish now, difficult to sign in. They change the layout every time I want to use it. They want more personal information all the time. I've stopped using it."

Skype,2018-04-30,1,"For a number of years, like many, I used Skype when it was, well, just Skype! Microsoft bought it, and that was the beginning of the end! Things changed, and all for the worse. And now, ladies and gentlemen, Skype AKA Microsoft are doing this, to adult users:''You need a parent's permission.Based on your age, we need your parent's permission before you can use this account. Using a web browser, sign in to account.microsoft.com to get your parent's permission and come back to try again''.The heavy handed stupidity then means, as with me, the adult cannot access their account, even if they have money credit. So, one then has to open a Microsoft Account, simply to contact Microsoft, and then they either ask you to adopt the child, even though I am not a child, and in adopting and verifying, they ask for PAYMENT! Yes, the parent, guardian or simply the person trying to get their adult account back up and running, is supposed to give back details or CC card details, and pay 50 pence, just to allow the account to go back to how it was, before Microsoft's thug policing interfered! They only offer an alternative which is to put through an ID request, So, I sent them my driver's licence, scanned. Two weeks ago! All I got back was some impersonal, dim-wit Microsoft email, asking for the ID, again, as they claimed it was not attached! So, this was sent, I emailed from both private email and said awful, new Microsoft account and guess what? Nothing! So, here we are, almost three weeks down the line, and Microsoft doing what it does best, which is interfere and bully, and do nothing! PLUS they wanted money, up front, from an adult, as they accused me of being a minor. The thing is, they are doing this to all non Microsoft members of Skype, and it is so transparent, as they almost force you into creating a new account with them! This is nothing to do with the various adult platforms dealing with underage threats or misuse, this is Microsoft flexing it's bullying muscles again and if you don't play ball, they block accounts, and do not deal with issues! This is why I dumped my Windows PC five years ago, and celebrated being free of the Microsoft and Windows grip! So, maybe I dump Skype> Maybe we should all dump both?!"
Skype,2018-04-28,1,Skype is dying. Microsoft is killing Skype. Shame on you Microsoft.
Skype,2018-04-27,1,"I would give zero stars if i could. There are noting in this world that M$ can't crap on it to become useless!All the useful features - gone. Frequent changes of the interface making it worse and worse. Support is useless. Gathering personal data by all means including forcing the users to scan ID cards to ""proof"" that they are adults, forgetting that this same account was paying for ""corporate"" few months ago."
Skype,2018-04-23,1,I have relied on skype for years but now I'm going to have to find an alternative. The new version is a pile of crap and unfit for purpose.
Skype,2018-04-23,1,i like skype 7 a hell of a lot better then skype 8 and the only reason i unscribed from version 7 was i was having password issued and got tired of the crap but to be honestly version 8 is twice as bad and i am angered  that by unstalling version 7 i lost all my contacts and that bites big time!  Very frustrated right now may try to go back and get skype 7 again as skype 8 sucks to be quite honest!!!
Skype,2018-04-23,N/A,N/A
Skype,2018-04-20,1,"The new Skype 8 for Windows is utterly terrible. What is that happened to GUI design in the industry during last years? We can see a massive decrease of functionality for some odd kind of  ""flat design"" fashion which is not only harder to navigate but also leaves a lot of screen space totally unused. Tons of settings and keyboard shortcuts disappeared without a trace. Quoting is horribly broken. Microsoft, please, replace your hipster ""designers"" with functionality-oriented developers. I am sticking with Skype 7 and looking out for an alternative IM."

The person changed my email address to his, deleted my number and took over my account. Now I've been with customer support on chat over 3 hours (2 sessions) and still no way to recover my account. Terrible service, would not recommend. Skype used to be a good service, now me including all my friends use other - more user friendly - apps."

Skype,2018-04-04,N/A,"Great free connection to most people worldwide, however their vulnerability to hackers and viruses makes the program unusable unfortunately. The risk of having your own personal computer/mobile device being controlled through skype, by a hacker makes the user experience very much negative and has made me as a once regular user, no longer use the program."

Skype,2018-03-26,1,I had to get on skype for an interview and it literally crashed about 10 times while just trying to pick a screen color option. i HATE the new skype. it's horrible. the design is horrible and it's completely UN-user friendly.
Skype,2018-03-26,N/A,"Skype was a great service until the recent updates, which are just hideous. Can't sign in from facebook anymore, don't have a microsoft account, built a new email to sign in because apparently my .edu email address won't work.  And then it required cell phone confirmation, and I don't have a cell phone, which is why I use Skype in the first place.Didn't see any warning about the new login system, now have Skype credit trapped in an account I can't access, which is just awful.After making several hours a week of Skype calls for almost eleven years, I'm finding a new platform."
Skype,2018-03-22,N/A,"Never used it much, so it came as a surprise that it was such crap when I did several months after the ""upgrade""...  Wait, I'm not really surprised, in fact. Microsoft has made some good stuff in the past, not great, but good. However, with garbage such as Windows 8 - 10, it's no surprise that Microsoft can be like King Midas but in reverse. Everything they touch turns to crap."

EMAIL CONTACTS FOR EMAIL AND SKYPE CONTACTS FOR PHONING/TEXTING WHAT PART OF THAT DON'T YOU GUYS GET?!  You effin' dumb-asses have REALLY messed it up this time!  The old Skype was perfect for what it was...why the hell are you trying to compete with FB messenger, which is a social contact app...A TOY...!!  THE OLD SKYPE HAD FEATURES THAT WERE REALLY USEFUL AND WORKED AND WAS WELL-ORGANIZED AND HELD ALL MY PHONE CONTACTS. NOW IT'S ALL GONE!!! YOUR NEW DOWN-GRADED SKYPE IS A PIECE OF USELESS GARBAGE!!

I rang the company and the guy explained me bought the same number from Skype 10 years ago, and ported it away from Skype 3-4 years ago as they were so useless. So, I go back to Skype to explain that they have charged me for something they did not even own, and am getting the run around by the utterly useless offshore support clowns. I have just been robbed of £92 for something I never received, they never had to sell, never worked, and now I am having to fight them to get my money back."

Skype,2018-02-17,1,"Since Skype is taken over by Microsoft, Skype App became pathetic.But the major problem is that Microsoft is over billing the Skype customers secretly which I can now call intentional FRAUD. This does not happen just one time but many times. For example they continue to bill the cancelled subscription. When I started a chat they denied that subscription was cancelled and I had no proof because I never expected Skype to cheat me so I did not took the screenshot and it never emailed me any cancellation email so I asked the chat agent to now cancel it and write it down so that I have a proof by taking the screenshot of chat and he confirmed that now he has cancelled and it will not bill again but on next due date it got billed again and I contacted them again and they just gave lame excuses and still did not refund the extra billed money and said that due to some technical issue it was billed again. But technical issue was not my fault. It was set for 3 months billing and I can't keep checking every three months if they bill my card secretly or not as I make many purchases with my card. And it is not an excuse to bill me so much more for their system issues. I told them it was cheating and they just said that they can only apologize and refund is not in their control due to system problem.I have a many numbers purchased from Skype and I can not get rid of it now because those numbers are already given to many clients of ours. We have a Skype Manager account which was promised to get a priority support. But since Microsoft took over, it became a nightmare. Same thing happen again for a yearly number purchase and I got really angry and told them that they must refund the money because number was failed to be registered by their system and they still secretly billed my card so they said that they will refund it because I threaten to go public this time. The chat agent said the amount is refunded in Skype account but when I checked few dollars balance that was in Skype Credit was also gone instead getting my $30.00 back in Skype. So I told the chat agent that you guys are trying to make me fool but he said that he refunded it to my card and all amount will show on my card in few days. It is two months now but amount never showed in my card and if I am going to call them again they will give same lame excuses that not sure what happened. If I go for chargeback, they can cancel my remaining numbers giving the reason of the dispute. So now Skype is basically fraud and black mailer also. I have started a chat more than 20 minutes ago and still it is showing following wait message and I invest so much time in the issues that were already discussed and promised to be resolved after investing a lot of my time and effort:==We are experiencing higher than normal wait times. Thanks for your patience. You're still in line for chat.==This is 100% genuine review. Skype case number is 1407531109 New clients avoid Skype's paid subscription and existing clients slowly move paid services away to some decent and honest company."

Everything in it, has problems. You can't even copy text rom the chat and paste it correctly. The chat window is too small and you cannot resize it, when you have the call view open. It misscalls contact, if you are typing on one chat and a incoming call occurs, the next key that you tap, will answer the call, weher you like it or not. There's no configuration options. The only thing missing from the latest release would be an even uglier UI design and some kind of heavy adware. This would make it the perfect all time candidate on how not to do software. The notifications sounds do not work. The sound quality and general call quality, which ought to be the CORE and MOST IMPORTANT feature are the same or worse. And many others issues that I just cannot be bothered to write.

In California gift cards purchased (basically advance credit) can't legally expire, so how does skype get away with keeping money you paid them for credit which hasn't been used? Regarding another issue, in attempting to reach a skype representative through their online chat feature, I waited for over 50 minutes as I was informed there was heavy volume, but I was still in line to reach an agent. When an agent finally came online, I was told they could not help me because a system update was in progress. Anybody who knows anything about computer systems realizes they could have generated a message explaining that the system update was in progress and for customers to try again later, but, instead, their failure to implement a simple solution kept dozens of customers waiting, collectively, for hours. What's worse is that in chatting with a supervisor the next day, he didn't know enough to realize this and dismissed my suggestion, saying I didn't understand their system. Terrible customer service!"
Skype,2018-01-18,2,"Ik zou graag meer sterren willen geven, maar helaas heb ik al een lange tijd geen beste ervaring met Skype. Ik maak graag en regelmatig gebruik van Skype, maar nu er eenmaal behoorlijk veel berichten zijn verzonden duurt het laden soms ellenlang. Een call opstarten duurt ook letterlijk 1 minuut, en soms kan het programma spontaan vastlopen. Het programma zelf vond ik prima - tot er ineens een nieuwe update kwam. Een update die ik niet kan begrijpen. Het programma is onvoorstelbaar langzaam geworden en heeft allemaal ""leuke"" features zoals 'golfjes' als iemand aan het typen is en een nieuw layout. Leuk en aardig, maar hierdoor is Skype niet meer fatsoenlijk te gebruiken omdat het constant vastloopt en berichten pas na een aantal seconden zichtbaar zijn na het sturen. Kortom, tot op zekere hoogte een mooi programma, maar een slim idee kan zijn om af en toe alle chats leeg te gooien en absoluut niet de nieuwste Skype, maar een oudere versie te gebruiken."

Then again, I don't carewhat MS does- I will no longer be using Skype."
Skype,2018-01-14,1,"This is the worst version of Skype ever.Hard to manage, poor menu's horrible connection problems.We rely on this for business and communication across the world, it has become a disaster!If WhatsAp had a complete desktop version Skype would be dead!"

Skype,2018-01-12,N/A,"It became less reliable and user-friendly then it was before, definitely. Though still good to use as a free chat with those insisting on using skype, and for calls from time to time."

Skype,2018-01-10,N/A,"The latest update is pants. The GUI is confusing and not easy to use. Lost all my contacts blah blah. The previous version was fine, if it aint broke why fix it?"
Skype,2018-01-10,1,"What happened? Suddenly calls keep dropping. I can't have multiple chat windows open. The window on my desktop takes up half the screen for no particular reason. When a call is coming in, the ringtone comes out of my desktop speakers even though the audio is set for the headset.  And that's on the PC. I'm guessing that my voice calls will continue to be put on perpetual hold on the iphone every time an alarm goes off. I have been a paying customer for years. Now contemplating the annoying project of finding a replacement that gives me back seamless service delivery. Luckily I am still able to download ""classic skype"" - wonder how long this will last! On the last Win10 update, it automatically replaced ""classic skype"" with ""newCrapSkype"" and I had to go find the download again at skype.com /get-skype"
Skype,2018-01-10,1,"Rubbish, it is not even worth 1 star. The UI is taking too much empty space. I can't open multiple chats at the same time. And people can't see me online. Perfect way to kill a good product, unbelievable."

I am considering dropping it as I and my family are using it less and less everyday. This is a heads up Microsoft, take your head out of the bucket and look around. Hire some quality engineers instead of cheap ones that you think are talented, -obviously they are not- and your recruitment process should be reconsidered."

Skype,2017-12-21,1,"If only I could give a minus star! This has to be the worst ever ""up-grade"" ever. Who came up with the brainwave to take away all the useful functionality and instead add childish gimmicks. I'm sure Microsoft had their top team working on this up-grade!

It reflects such a lack of respect for clients that we are looking at alternatives, even those we'll have to pay for.I will gladly pay not to use such crapware."
Skype,2017-12-11,1,Skype's latest update is appalling and has no redeeming features ( unless you are 5 years old and like emojis)! Previously useful functions have simply been dispensed with. Sort yourselves out Skype or people will migrate to other services.
Skype,2017-12-08,N/A,"WORST UPDATE EVER........I have used Skype for over 15 years for business communication and overseas voip telephony, but since Microsoft took over they have absolutely killed everything. Why on earth anyone would think it was a good idea to remove all the existing critical functionality and replace it with childish gimmicks like a colourful interface is beyond me. I can't even access the contact list on my mobile phone anymore. Instead have to search for the contact, then copy and paste the phone number over to Skype application to make a call. It's a fricken voip telephone service...what possessed you to unlink the contact list?? Seriously?? No words!! I never take the time to write reviews, but I guess I'm really hoping someone at Microsoft is listening. To put it as nicely as possible, you've basically taken a perfectly good, feature rich product and turned it into a colourful featureless piece of rubbish (I wanted to use a much harsher four letter word). Good work!!!"
Skype,2017-12-05,1,this is impossible. It used to be a tool for business calls and chats. Now it looks like Facebook chat. Makes me sick. An absolutely horrible update which I was forced to install because the old version refused to run on my Macbook and required an update. Sucks big time.
Skype,2017-12-05,N/A,Jeg har altid haft skype..Men den venlige brugeflade man kender den er helt væk.Jeg begriber ikke hvorfor man ødelægger noget der fungerede så godt..Det værste er at der ikke er noget alternativ til skype.. Så må leve med det indtil der kommer noget der ligner det gamle skype.

Skype,2017-11-17,1,"I would give 0 stars if I could. I was a Skype user for more than 10 years, until I was locked out of my account, simply because I got a new laptop and my old one was dead, so I couldn't access the account through that.  I had not forgotten my password, but didn't have access to the old email I had used when I originally signed up. I was send through an incredibly cumbersome verification process, asking for information from when I first signed up, as I said more than 10 years ago.  I provided credit card and payment info that  was correct and my security word.  I did this on my own at least 3 times and was denied access every time.   I finally chatted with someone from the support team for almost 1.5 hours and it was an absolutely horrible experience and complete waste of my time.  I was asked to do the same thing over and over again to recover my account, even though I explained from the start that I had tried that multiple times.  It never worked and the guy didn't try to find any other way of solving the issue, just saying it can't be done.  I have a balance on the account and he would not even give me a refund.  My money is basically being stolen.  The account recovery process is completely ridiculous, asking for information from more than 10 years ago and security words being ""not enough"". According the to the guy I chatted with, there is no way to send me a recovery link, besides through that process.  It's hard to believe a technology company has no real way to troubleshoot a technical problem.  Skype obviously doesn't care about a customer who had used the service for more than 10 years and paid hundreds of dollars in that period. This is completely unacceptable."
Skype,2017-11-17,1,"Accessing my Skype account is a massive problem. Since Microsoft has taken over Skype when I attempt to log in it requires a stack of information about the account which includes credit card details for a monthly invoice from Microsoft in connection with another product and then denies that I have ""proven my identity"" and excludes me from my Skpe account.  Customer unfriendly doesn't begin to describe it."

Then says.......outlook dot ie isn't in our system. Make sure you typed your email address correctly. It usually looks like outlook.dot comMy account IS the .ie. I DO NOT have a .com account.I was asked a couple of times to do a verification thing to make sure it was, in fact, me, with a whole load (it went on and on) of stupid questions. Some could only be answered if I was logged in!! The stupidity of them (Skype).Why do they need this if I have my password and my username? Why not just a simple code to my mobile phone?Their agents are totally inept. They took over my computer 4 times and I had to stop them One guy was where he should not have been...on my desktop and hovering over my folder shortcuts!! He actually clicked on one......can you believe?I have spent hours and hours with these useless guys and got nowhere.Yes. I uninstalled maybe 6 times, cleared the cache, etc etc. All to no avail.Funny thing...the App works fine on my Samsung.MS has made a right mess out of Skype and I am looking now for another VOIP provider.

Skype,2017-10-06,N/A,"I called customer support to rectify a situation where I've had two existing subscriptions. A 1 month and a 3 month... these should not even co-exist and I don't know how they both existed. Lag time between canceling, switching or somehow they both were created at the same exact time. I usually get 3-4 e-mail confirmations about the same transaction from my e-mail and phone about the transaction so it's easily dismiss-able to WHICH transaction is being taken place.I contacted the customer service, not only where they condescending, they make it entirely your fault despite admitting for having a faulty system at that time and stating that it no longer does that now. I have screenshots of the conversation as it won't let me have a transcript, possibly from the terrible customer service they provide.I asked for a refund and told them that there was a greater issue than just bandaging the current issue at hand. I asked him to cancel all my subscriptions and it became apparently hostile. After I received the cancellation confirmation and told him so, he immediately disconnected, completely unprofessional.If this individual couldn't handle my case or issue, I should have been sent to someone that could either come to a better resolution instead of hanging up immediately. Absolutely terrible."

Skype,2017-09-27,4,"Overall, Skype is a good service. I do have slight connection/quality problems from time to time but for a free service I can't really complain. Their screensharing feature is also a great to have as not only does it work well, the quality is also quite clear."

Skype,2017-09-10,1,"The new rewamp of Skype is a complete disaster. Having spent hours trying to use it without getting anywhere, I have now deleted it and using Viber instead. If I could I would give the app less than 0 stars - shame on Microsoft!"
Skype,2017-09-08,N/A,"My solid old iphone 4s (usable in all respects prior to this upgrade) can no longer use Skype. Skype is a messaging platform and there is no reason why a phone such as this cannot run a simple messaging program. Microsoft have simply decided to make a new app and then restrict access to older versions. Have tried the 'zany' new social media makeover on another Android phone and it makes the application rather horrible to use for a traditional user that simply wants to transfer a message. In addition, the installation of the new app turned my status to online, whereas it has always been set to 'invisible' - I am not impressed.  I have decided to transfer my usage to whatsapp, all my phones, desktops, the lot, my whole family. Surprised and annoyed."
Skype,2017-09-08,N/A,Opened up window to call a number and typed the number in and dialled it and call went ok. Then deleted number in the box to call a new number. Skype called the old number again. Found out that this is some crazy feature Skype added which is not user friendly and annoying. Instead they tell you to 'close the call window and open it again for every call you want to make'. Sorry Skype you just lost a customer out of embarrassment due to calling someone over and over when another number was displayed. Do your developers actually test their product on simple casual users or are they out to make the skype experience as frustrating as possible nowadays?
Skype,2017-09-01,1,"Har fået downloaded den nye Skype til Windows, jeg er langt fra imponeret.. Hvad skete der med den intuitive brugerflade..Det er blevet væsentligt sværere at finde rundt i menupunkter, og nogle kan jeg slet ikke finde mere. Rigtig ærgerlig at det går denne vej, det har været et godt program, men må siges at være tæt på ubrugelig som det er nu. Mobil versionen er endnu værre.. Hvad får jer til at ændre et rigtig godt og brugervenlig program til et stykke software som ikke kan bruges uden man skal følge diverse guides og wiki's på nettet. Alle andre software udviklere prøver at gøre tingene mere bruger venlig så selv den ældre fru Hansen kan finde rundt. Det lader til at Skype har valgt at gøre det svære. Jeg forstår det ikke."
Skype,2017-08-27,N/A,"It is by far worst video chat application ever made. I have it installed on two Nexus 7 tablets, Nexus 6P phone and two Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 and S3 tablets.  Also valrious PCs (Win 7 and 10) and Mac. Interface is different on each device.  It is hard to explain to older people (my parrents) every time Skype team makes change to interface and they have no clue where to find contacts anymore but Skype offers them tons of different things that are completely useless for most of the people.  I'm done with that  crap. There are better alternatives.  At least Hangouts looks same on all systems including Windows PCs, Macs, tablets and phones."
Skype,2017-08-26,N/A,"When MSN Messenger was no longer an option, Skype was the best alternative. Since that point, the company really have become far too full of themselves. Bugs are plenty and updates to fix them are few. There are far more issues to condemn Skype than there are to praise it.Here are some frequent issues:1. Pending / Undelivered Text You can be typing away without issue when suddenly your messages are met with a spinning circle pending connection. At this moment, it's common to check if your internet is experiencing issues or perhaps the fault is with your partner (Whomever you're typing to). Commonly, I will send a message to someone else at this point to discover if the fault is on my end or on the other users end. Most, if not all times, I am met with the same issue, that messages sent to anyone from me are pending. I then decide to check my browser and load up websites or videos to ensure I am receiving a connection. The connection is fine, everything else works as intended apart from Skype. This typically lasts anywhere from 1 minute to 5 before the messages will all suddenly send at once.2. Accidental CallsIf you accidentally hit the keys Ctrl+Q, you have hit the short keys to initiate a call within Skype. Typically, this happens when the user has accidentally hit Ctrl rather than Shift. Now, if you call someone and did not mean to, the easiest thing to do is press the cancel call button before the other person answers. However, after having tested this specifically 10 times in a row, both my skype program and the other users skype that receives the call, crashes and stops responding. I tested this multiple times and without fail, every single test, it had the same result of both participants skype not responding.3. Skype on Mobile Skype on mobile is simply not a viable option whatsoever. Regardless of how powerful the hardware your phone sports, Skype will inevitably hit a stand-still and is required to be shut down and reloaded. It starts out fine, being able to type at any speed you're capable of. However, as typing goes on, the keyboard begins to lag and suddenly you're having to slow yourself down to pressing individual letters slowly and steadily while the on-screen keyboard has a chance to catch up.At this point, to prevent it getting worse, you are required to close the app and re-open to refresh. This happens without fail on a regular basis.Conclusion: Skype has many issues that require immediate attention, yet regardless of how many complaints are put online and how many issues are voted highly in the realms of needing fixed, Skype falls silent. We have updates that change the appearance and interface of Skype, giving it a new look and feel, however the same issues from the past persist. If skype wishes to compete with other upcoming services, they really need to begin listening to their user base and not shunning them.Review date: 26th August 2017 Skype version: 7.39.0.102 (most up to date version at the time of this review)"

Skype,2017-07-29,N/A,"This is an edit from an abysmal review I wrote earlier. There are four things I don't like:1) I am very confused about logging on with username or password. If I log on with username, it seems to be an entirely different account, and nothing works.2) It is very difficult to find the links for live help. FAQs don't help much. On the other hand, once you're in a chat with tech help, things go pretty smoothly.3) When you pay for a service, Skype automatically makes it a recurring charge. This is nakedly profit seeking, and should not happen. I'm quite capable of deciding if I want to continue the service or not, thank you.4) The add credit thing is confusing. I wasn't seeing my subscription show up (see issue #1), so I added credit. I hope I can apply that to my subscription rate over the next couple months. Unfortunately, there are a lot of horror stories online about that, so I guess we'll see."

Skype,2017-07-24,N/A,"My Skype experience as a user has been very clunky, and ever since I used it on Windows 10 I encountered numerous problems. The most common one would be the calls randomly dropping out and video calls sometimes freezing. But the worst part about this is that it keeps pestering you with updates. I've been suckered into updating this software on a regular basis, and I always do it in hope that it may remedy the problems I had earlier, but instead nothing's been fixed. In fact I'd say the updates made it worse. Now my video camera won't even respond. It tells me to close down other programs that may be using it (even if Skype is the only program that's cocking open), and the call dropouts are just as annoying as ever.There's no reason for all these updates if they can't even fix the most basic of problems.

Skype,2017-05-31,1,What happened to Skype during recent times? Did the sane ones die off? It used to be good and in the last year or so it's gone completely downhill.To summarize: Cut outs in call quality. Absolute ZERO customer service. And worst of all - after an update my mic stopped working properly (both internal and various plug-in devices) and I tried every way to fix it - there is also no way of rolling back and using an older working version of Skype.To make matters worse. Skype web doesn't even work with Firefox browser.I can only say that Microsoft's days must be numbered if this is the way they are heading. To call this companies policies and actions of the last year r-tarded would be an insult to r-tards everywhere.

Skype,2017-03-02,N/A,"I have used Skype for years. It was a wonderful service and solved so many problems for me.  What is there now is not Skype.  It does not deserve the name. Its disappearing makes me sad.  It was a good thing.What is there now is some version of a non communication nightmare that has no real customer service but rather endless loops. It is possible that you will be charged for something you do not want to be charged for. It is unlikely you will be able to file the form to get it back. You will want to close your account. You will become bewildered about how to do so. You will  try and try to follow the loop to customer support, be forced to join Microsoft something or other while so doing.  That will not help you. You will be switched back and forth across web and non-web Skype and into microsoft verification forms endlessly. I largely feel neutral about Bill Gates and how he has earned his fortune and then gives from it.  I did admire the giving piece.   This fake Skype changed that for me. His affiliation with this product, bewilders me.  It is truly terrible now and feels like it steals from people by how it charges and evades - recourse.  He would do well to discontinue his affiliation with it soon before it really damages his reputation."

I have to go through an activation hoop, if I have time/notice that my 3.22 cents is expiring within another 180 days. You are burdening happy customers with mindless games to save transfer balances from customers to your balance sheet.

The system is slow and integration with Outlook extremely poor.As a comparison, the good ole fashion MSN Messenger was a far better and more simplistic package.If we now compare any of the Skype editions to a modern competitor such as WhatsApp - it's way behind the times with integration, speed and device support.Come on Microsoft - SORT IT OUT!!!!"

I filled out this form 3 times and they said each time that I did not fill it out correctly so they can't discuss this any further.  I copied the information directly from the logged in account, so I can only believe that this is deliberate so that they don't have to support you.  Not supporting you means that they can keep your money.  The timing of the hack is especially suspicious as it happened straight after I reactivated some old credit on the account.  I firmly believe that the attitude among their support staff is to deny support.  The biggest worry though is that since they are owned by Microsoft now, any credit cards you have on file with Microsoft Live for other services are SHARED with Skype.  So they will continue to defraud.  I've given them plenty of opportunity to resolve this, even tweeting them.  They even said their supervisor would contact me but nothing.

Naiv som man er, så satte jeg opdateringen i gang. Man skulle så være opmærksom på at programmet oprettede et nyt ikon som man skulle bruge i stedet for det gamle, når man åbnede programmet. Men denne opdatering bevirkede så at jeg ikke længere kunne ringe op eller skrive sms’er fra programmet. Knappen med telefonrøret var ganske enkelt deaktiveret. Efter en genstart kunne jeg end ikke få lov at logge ind. Jeg blev TVUNGET til at ændre min adgangskode til min Microsoft konto for at prøve at logge ind på Skype. Men jeg kunne stadig ikke få lov til at logge ind. Jeg forsøgte så at afinstallere programmet og installere det på ny. 3 gange. Med samme resultat. Den blå skærm med ”timeglascirklen” kører i 3-4 minutter, før man får at vide at ”Skype kan ikke oprette forbindelse”. Det er IKKE muligt at kontakte Skype for support. Hverken på mail eller telefon. Man henvises blot til deres Community. Som er et forum med tusindvis af andre frustrerede Skype-brugere, der må sætte deres lid til at nogen kan løse netop deres problem med Skype. For folkene bag Skype hjælper dig i hvert fald ikke! Jeg forsøgte så at oprette et indlæg i Community. Men nej. Når jeg trykker send, så fejler siden, og jeg får besked på at ’sende oplysningerne igen’. Med andre ord; heller ikke dér var det muligt at søge hjælp. Da jeg for sidste gang afinstallerede Skype fik jeg en enestående chance for at skrive hvorfor jeg dog forlod Skype. Jeg pakkede ikke noget ind, men fortalte dem råt for usødet hvad jeg mente om deres program, opdateringer og ikke-eksisterende support. Det er ikke første gang jeg har haft disse problemer med Skype. I den tid jeg har brugt programmet har jeg måttet reinstallere det 8-10 gange. Og hver gang har jeg været irriteret over deres support, som kun er baseret på at andre brugere kan hjælpe. Men denne gang lykkedes det ikke at få Skype til at virke. Når Skype ikke virker, når man ikke selv kan lave det, når producenten ikke vil hjælpe og tilmed blokerer for den hjælp, man kunne søge hos andre brugere, der også er ladt i stikken, så er det på tide at sige farvel og tak. Næste udfordring bliver at få standset deres automatiske træk på min konto til det abonnement, jeg ikke længere kan bruge. Jeg kan af gode grunde ikke selv logge ind og standse det. Og det er sjovt nok det eneste der virker upåklageligt hos Skype, nemlig at der bliver trukket penge fra ens konto... Hold jer væk fra Skype!!!!!"

It didn't matter that my account was set up years ago before they even entered into the partnership. The individual I was speaking with, didn't even bother to check these details, instead I was requested to verify my address by sending them a bank statement/ bill (?!?!) Once document received, the process on their end would take min 24-48 hours. Of course, she was deaf to me saying that I urgently need to purchase the service, I'm not based in Korea, I don't even speak Korean and I only holidayed there for 4 days! She also did not care explaining why Skype members are not being warned that using Skype from selected countries can link their accounts to some dodgy Skype substitutes. This is my 2nd run in with Skype's shocking customer service in 4 weeks, both were equally ridiculous and frustrating. Skype used to be my favourite service, but it has hit rock bottom, time for a replacement."
Skype,2018-07-06,N/A,If you need Skype for any sort of chat/voice/video that deos NOT include using a regular mobile or landline telephone connection Skype is competative - However if you need to use it in order to purchase a telephone number is any of a wide variety of countries - avoid it like a plague because the prices are truly outrageous ($6 a month compared to $0-$1 a month by average of the sites that I examined - and if you want a refund  - keep on dreaming!

Skype,2015-05-20,1,"DO NOT TOP UP YOUR SKYPE ACCOUNT!!!It is probably rated TOP SECRET and above by Microsoft... how many accounts have been locked due to their software failure and later the inability to say the simple word ""Sorry""... what is even worse is that third party attempting to infiltrate your account to prevent sending your messages as in cases with human rights violation... leads automatically to lock down of the account. In a way that means that the government can shut down now practically all your accounts GMAIL, SKYPE, YAHOO, FACEBOOK by just attempting to sign in... to recover your account is unfortunately not that simple. Basically if you give SKYPE all the information it ask from you, you shouldn't wonder if your bank account is infiltrated thereafter: SKYPE and Microsoft are aware of it and yet willingly or unwillingly they are supporting criminals and militant regimes with their inability to see pass their rules of secrecy...Considering the absolute disinterest from Microsoft to provide adequate service and take customer seriously... there is only one conclusion possible. The independent SKYPE was too much of annoyance for corporate America... as long SKYPE existed no one would have made money. Considering the amount Microsoft paid for SKYPE and the disinterest now it is more than a conspiracy theory. The new way of doing business... buy it, run it down and dispose of it. If Microsoft was the alone buyer or it was a joint venture we will of course never know.  What we have here is a war between corporate America and the independent world of the free users. Most of us are using Facebook and despite the poor quality still hanging to the ruins of SKYPE without giving it a thought... no wonder with generation of papa Simpson coming into being we have never been in graver danger to go under the wheels of the corporate and government whimsicalities.Stop using SKYPE or you are putting your life and the life of other people in danger. Jani Jakimov"
Skype,2015-04-09,N/A,"I have been using skype for several years in work capacity. It was a fabulous product until MS took over. Since then it has been on a downhill due to Microsoft trying to monopolise it and add unnecessary features to it to make profits out of the software.Very poor stability, awful user experience, application unstable most of the time, Inability to answer calls, multiple interfaces kicking up on incoming calls, issues when multiple sound devices connected and the list goes on. Shameful for a company like MS who has huge brain, technology and financial resources."
Skype,2017-03-24,N/A,"JA JA SKYPE FUNGERER DA GODT.... MEN i skyggen af alle de gode funktioner Skype ligger frem til os forburgere, bliver de knapt så stuerene metoder fejet ind under tæppet. Her taler jeg om Skype-kredit, som man sætter ind på sin konto for derefter at kunne skrive og ringe til andet end computere. Det er en god mulighed at have, hvis det så bare ikke var fordi de kører det som en lyssky forretning! Hvis ikke man benytter pengene inden for et givent tidspunkt, tager Skype dem bare udenvidere, eller som de selv siger fjerner de inaktive midler og gør plads til aktive! Direkte ulovligt efter min mening, når man betaler for en service hvor idéen er hele tiden at have en kredit. Jeg nævnte det for en medarbejder, da de havde snuppet 80 dkk af mine penge, hvorefter hun sagde at de da havde advaret mig pr mail.. Direkte tyverie er åbenbart ok hvis man bare lige ligger en seddel.."
Skype,2015-03-22,1,"I sent a number of Skype sms text to my girlfriend's mobile and she received none of the messages, although I have £10 of credit.  After making the messages I was charged for them (the Skype credit has deductions made for the messages) and it says that they were delivered but she did not receive them.  When I use my regular Tesco mobile to contact her she receives the message.  I think Skype free services are excellent but their sms to a foreign mobile (UK to Austria) are a waste of money.  I only lost £10.  I suppose they collect revenue for their free services this way :-)  Last £10 you'll get from me."

Skype,2015-01-22,N/A,"I have had been using Skype for a few years as a free user, I starting working away from home so I subscribed to a Skype service with a recurring payment. Everything seemed great, then one day I received an email stated my email address had changed, then shortly after I received two emails from PayPal referring to two successful payments to Skype (this was all at the beginning of Oct 2013). I had not changed my email or made the payment so I tried to contact Skype, unfortunately Skype don't have a helpline number, they do have web chat but you need to log in, and at this time my password had also been changed by the person that had taken over my account. So I had to complete an online form, I received a reference and a note stating someone would contact me within 24hours. At this point someone was taking money from my account and Skype wanted me to wait, I contacted PayPal who stated that the payment was automatic so couldn't be stopped, so I phoned my bank, they stopped all payment to PayPal and the payment in process. So the next day I received an email from Skype stating that something with my request was incorrect and I was to follow a link to complete an online form, I selected the link which took me to the same page as I completed the day before, so I completed the form and also emailed Skype contactus address, again the message stated I would receive and email within 24 hours and again the same email back, to complete the online form. I replied to the emails but with no response, this went on until later November. So as I was getting nowhere I started to get fed up, so I tried the forgot password link after a few weeks of trying to change my password, I received a new one. So I could now access my account, when I logged into the account I noticed I was in credit for the two payment, so I tried the web chat to solve the problem but the guy told me to follow a link or try the contactus email, the link was for the online that I completed at the start, but I tried the form again but was still doing something wrong so nobody would help me, so I asked the online chat to help but again the same link. This went on for a bit, then in about March 2014 I received an email stating my account had been taken over so was block to protect me (5 months after I reported it), I tried to resolve the issue but got fed up, so stopped using Skype. It is now January 2015 and received an email stating my balance is due to expiry, this is to an account that is blocked. I am not saying don't use Skype because the free service is good but what ever you do don't use any paid service because your money isn't safe. When I had my problems I also posted it on the Skype online community, to my surprise I found that I wasn't alone and many people had lost money, some in the hundreds but Skype aren't interested."

Altså tyveri.Jeg kontakter nu Skype og spørger hvorfor?Fordi siger de ... at de ikke er sikker på, at jeg er ejeren af kontoen ???Jeg fortæller dem nu (i deres chat-support), at jeg allerede er logget ind på Skype-delen af kontoen, da jeg som den eneste af 7 milliarder mennesker kender koden. Men nej, dette var ikke nok ???Hun giver mig nu et link, til en formular jeg skal udfylde for 4. gang, som jeg også fortæller hende. Men nej igen. Hvis ikke jeg udfyldte formularen igen kunne de ikke hjælpe mig.Jeg åbner nu linket til formularen, men denne er nu også blokeret for kontoen som problemet vedrører.Det lykkedes nu at udfylde formularen vha. en anden konto-navn, og jeg slutter med at fortælle i kommentarfeltet, hvordan alting hænger sammen.Jeg klikker på send, og får beskeden, at jeg vil høre fra dem indenfor 24 timer. Og det er så 10 dage siden nu. Og ja, du har gættet det; ""ingen svar"". Jo, Skype er bare endnu et svindlerfirma, som gør alting forkert, når det kommer til kundesupport.Og hvor er det bare trist, at Microsoft nu har indgået et partnerskab med disse tyveknægte."

Skype,2014-06-02,N/A,"Update: After much time, many emails with requests and very bad reviews online, I finally managed to get my discount, so I change this review from 1 to 3 stars.Background: I was purchasing an item online, and it had a 20% discount on it. First of all, it took very long for Skype online shop to process my order. Second, they ""forgot"" about the discount. Then, when I contacted customer support, they assured me they would take care of it. Nothing happened. I asked and asked, they said they would deal with it. Month and a half - and nothing has happened!Furthermore, as I live in Denmark with very high customs fees, I only wanted to buy something shipped out of Europe to avoid customs fees. This product was shipped out of Hong Kong, which they mentioned nothing about online. I contacted customer support also about this, and the same thing happened: They said they would deal with it, ""rest assured"" and other meaningless words, and nothing has ever happened. Finally, the product is not the quality that was described online at all! The price for that product was way too high for its value. Be careful."

Det eneste man skulle gøre, var at gå ind på en bestemt hjemmeside, indtaste sin e-mail, også ville man få en kode tilsendt. Den 24. december 2013, har jeg forsat ikke modtaget nogen kode fra Skype, men jeg er derimod begyndt at modtage reklametilbud fra Skype, tilbud jeg slet ikke modtog før jeg tilmelde mig. Det er efter min mening ulovlig markedsføring, da de ikke har leveret et abonnement, som man blev lovet ved tilmelding. Jeg har forsøgt at skrive til Skype på mail. Desværre så har de gjort alt for at skjule en kontakt formular, og den eneste måde jeg kan få hjælp på, er ved at jeg først køber et Premium abonnement, så jeg kan tale med den på Live chat.  Men jeg vil ikke betale for et abonnement, som jeg allerede burde have fået gratis, da jeg blev lovet det ved tilmelding den 20. december.  Min eneste mulighed er derfor, at skrive til Skype her også håbe på at de svare tilbage den fejl.

Skype,2013-11-10,N/A,"In the past three months I have lost just under $100 from spammers on Skype.  My account was used as a spammer's delivery tool in Sweden. Over one-thousand SMS texts were sent from my account - half in September and half early November.  In September, a hacker gained access to my account and began to spam people in Sweden with texts. I promptly went to Skype customer service - attempted to resolve the issue, be refunded and move on. We took all the necessary steps to recover my account and make sure that nobody gained access to it again. Customer service agreed to refund me for the ""Auto-recharge"" cycles that occurred 5 times during the hacker's shenanigans and cost me $14 each time. Since then I have cancelled auto-recharge. However, I have still not been refunded. If that isn't enough - in the past few days THE EXACT SAME THING has happened to me.  I followed the same steps, talked to Skype customer service.. did all of the security measures to ensure that it didn't happen again. I explained to them that even though my ""auto-recharge"" was turned off - it WAS STILL HAPPENING. They promptly continued on with the same security measures that did not protect me the first time... or the second time.  Upon me asking for a refund due to their inability to secure my account, the customer service rep then told me that it's not their responsibility.  Allow me to make that clear to anyone willing to give Skype their personal information and/or money - IT IS NOT SKYPES' RESPONSIBILITY TO KEEP YOUR ACCOUNT SECURED. After spending 1.5hrs on the live chat with a customer service rep dodging my requests for a refund, he told me that they needed to ""convert this communication to email so we could further investigate the said issue"".

I want to customize my text into different color depending on who i chat with, I can't. I want to change background of my chat room I can't.

Skype gave me the ability to not only talk to them, but also see them through video chat. I have been able to see my nieces and nephews grow up even thought I'm not near them Instead of meeting every Christmas, I get to see my family every week. The same goes for my friends from school that live in other states and even other countries. Skype has let me keep in touch with the people that I love."
Skype,2012-10-18,N/A,"This thing makes life much easier. It gives me an opportunity to take interviews, have conversations with friends and collegues not just on my pc, but on the go as well. Love it!"

Skype,2012-09-27,N/A,Great way to communicate with a great value.
Skype,2012-09-18,N/A,This is one of the greatest things ever.I love talking to my sister who lives in NY face to face.I feel like we still live together and have not missed anything.It is amazing seeing her everyday
Skype,2012-09-11,N/A,"I am personally online very much of the day. Instead of owning a smartphone i just use skype, i have made a little list why i love skype. 1. It's free. And i mean completly free, no ""2 hours a week-rule""2. It's easy, fast and reliable.3. Amazing sound quality. It will go as far as your microphone will.4. Webcam? Share your screen? They got it all."
Skype,2012-08-31,N/A,Good service and low prices
Skype,2012-08-29,N/A,God til at kommunikere med chat og snak. Både fra computer og mobil. Absolut Genialt!
Skype,2012-08-24,N/A,"I have been a skype user since there were just 30,000 users on the system. A long time. I have enjoyed many good years and hundreds of hours with friends and relatives all over the world.On the strength of this I created a Business account, added my credit card details, added work colleagues, never really benefitted from group screen sharing because it never worked and it turned out to be an expensive console to add or remove members.I have tried to cancel the subscription on my credit card, but it has not been possible because it tells me I should transfer credits to a user before I can do this. There is no way to do this because the web page for months has given me a system error. Today I received another subscription payment notification with my credit card statement...just to add further insult to injury! It's not even possible to delete an account. What's that all about? Even Facebook deletes photos now!Skype customer services hides behind pages of inter-linked information that goes around in circles of Q&A pages and when I have been able to find a mail address to write to I don't get an answer.Very disappointing. Now I use Viber."
Skype,2012-08-20,4,"The service is great - super useful. However, the software needs a lot of work.The settings are difficult to use and are not organised logically.The default sounds Skype ships with are horrible. Screen sharing now costs money? I understand that they need to make money - but I feel like I may need to look for a new alternative."
Skype,2012-08-02,N/A,I use it for all my long distance calls and it is a fantastic tool to keep phone bills under control.

Skype,2012-07-18,N/A,Thanks to Skype I can now see my grand daughters from across the country! This is great because getting most young kids on the phone for longer than a minute is hard. Give them video of themselves and me to star at and make funny faces helps keep their attention. Great product especially for free!
Skype,2012-07-17,N/A,"Does not required speed internet, more than enough WiFi connection and mobile internet"
Skype,2012-07-16,5,I am in love with Skype I can chat for hours on end with people around the globe.  Its absolutely fabulous! Even though if you want to make a call you have to pay how cares its cheap and easy to do.  Some people would prefer not paying so you can still chat if you have a webcam you can make a video call.
Skype,2012-07-16,N/A,best video chat software. really  like the simplicity of the messenger and great quality video communication.
Skype,2012-07-14,N/A,So far nothing beats SKYPE.

Skype,2012-07-11,5,"My grand children don't live close enough to me so Skype is my answer to having tea parties on screen with grand kids and there dolls/bears and who ever else is invited including bringing in other family on same chat, it is so brilliant as a family we have all sat chatting, watching the kids at play whilst drinking tea/coffee.  I can think of nothing better apart from living next door to my family."
Skype,2012-07-11,4,"It's easy, but it's a pity that internetconnection is not available in certain area's. So: Skyping in not possible. It happened also once that a message that was send to me, was delivered 3 days later."
Skype,2012-07-10,N/A,"I have tried almost all applications to create albums for the Web. Compared with JAlbum some are easier to use but it is profitable to devote two or three sessions to learn JAlbum thoroughly, then he discovers powerful options and practical features not found in more expensive commercial programs. I am very satisfied with the purchase although I have not experienced the sale of pictures and videos through PayPal, one of the distinctive possibilities of JAlbum. Very good!"
Skype,2012-07-10,N/A,"This is the best site that has proven extra-ordinary from it's counterparts. Glad to see that Facebook has the integration of Skype. So far, I never had any issues in using this product. Even downloading it from it's native site was no big deal. Am still a regular user of this product and I wholeheartedly recommend this product to all, because all the services including the customer service, is carried out so nicely by the corporate."
Skype,2012-07-09,2,"The phrase 'At least we're not paying for this' is often used in my Skype conversations, which is definitely true. If I had to pay for a shoddy video and distorted sound I would be royally pissed off. Thankfully I don't. But the reason I use Skype, apart from it being free, is that I am travelling. I must state that one reason for my terrible phone conversations could have something to do with the hostel's wi-fi connection, but half the time such an excuse is not valid. But it does the job (except when the call unexpectedly drops) and hey, at least I'm not paying for it."
Skype,2012-07-09,N/A,Thanks SKYPE to reduce my telephone bills. I can not only talk to my love once but can see them too... Thank you
Skype,2012-07-08,5,N/A

Skype,2012-07-03,4,"I use Skype on my iPad and have found really useful when I'm travelling and with more and more businesses using it, it's become an accepted means of communicating in business.  There have been one or two glitches for me with SMS messaging where messages have been delayed by a number of days, but no evidence of a delay at my end.  But this is an isolated incident.  Overall, it's invaluable."
Skype,2012-07-03,4,"what a great way to keep ion contact with my family and friends back home.sometimes its a bit laggy but ther then that its great!"

Skype,2012-06-25,2,"Takes up too much on the computer and takes ages to load. It rather gets in the way. I don't use it often but when I do it proves its worth. It is also irritating that this is yet another programme that lets in Spam,"
Skype,2012-06-24,5,"I live quite far away from my family so Skype is great for keeping in touch! It's great to let the family see how the little one is growing up too, until we can visit next. And it's free - what more do you want?!"
Skype,2012-06-23,N/A,"Skype would have got 5 stars, but the video likes to freeze up and calls get dropped, but what can u do when it's free and ur talking to people in different counties. I <3 skype and can't thank them enough it made his 12 month deployment easier on both of us. We skyped everyday several times per day!!!!! THX SKYPE!!!!!!!!!!!"
Skype,2012-06-21,N/A,"Jeg har brugt skype i mange år. Det er super tjeneste, der er gratis.  Men når man installere sin klient, er standart opstillingen rigtigt ringe.. Den ændre mine lyd instillinger i Windows plus at mine genvejstaster bliver ikke gemt på kontoen ^^ Det er nok det der er det største problem her. At kontoen ikke gemmer de instillinger man har i programmet. Den kan se hvem man er.. men det er det :-( Det der telefon konference er helt vildt dårligt! Man kan ikke se hvem der er superbruger og har styringen af konferencen :-( I kan lære noget af google på de to punkter! Jeg anbefaler Skype! Hvis man ikke kan bruge google, mumble eller teamspeak. I er ved at blive overhælet, kom i gang!"

Skype,2012-06-18,4,"I Skype with my son in California (I live in England) and it's great when it works, but sometimes we have problems.  Mostly, though, it's amazing to see my son and his family every week and we really enjoy our time on Skype."
Skype,2012-06-17,N/A,"I like Skype - and it works well enough.  However, the idea that my credits expired over time (a few years ago) is something I cannot tolerate.  We give money to them in advance - which means they have our money for a time without having to provide a service, then they tell us that we have to use them within a certain time period of they will confiscate the credits.  This is very poorly thought out approach since it alienates the customer for good.  It is like insult added to injury. If this policy were not in place, I would still be a spending customer with Skype.  The net profit for Skype with me would have been in the positive.  I'm afraid that this is a poor decision made by management that will cost Skype in the end."
Skype,2012-06-15,3,"keeps crashing my computer & made it run slower also skype keeps crashing mid way through a hat, but has its uses when it works its could ,"
Skype,2012-06-15,N/A,I'm always using skype services when I want to make long distance call with relatives. The quality of sound and image are very good.
Skype,2012-06-14,5,"Me & my partner communicate using Skype all the time, either through the laptops or iPhones because we are currently living in different countries and in a long distance relationship. It is a great, free way to stay in touch and it makes it slightly easier been so far away from each other for long periods of time! I know dont know what we would do without Skype!"
Skype,2012-06-12,4,i love skype but i think that not enough people use it! they should promote it more and make it less confusing to use like the paying for calls and tryng to find contacts.

Skype,2012-06-03,2,... need I say more?

Skype,2012-05-31,4,EASY TO USE THAT MEETS OUR NEEDS
Skype,2012-05-31,N/A,"When I am traveling around the world and need to call to airlines, credit card companies, financial companies, or businesses back in the US I use SKYPE to make those calls free.  I even use them at home instead of my cell phone for those long waits for 1-800 service.   Also, calls home are very cheap and easy to make from a good wifi connection with my iPad compared to using an international phone card from public phones.   I don't use the video feature very much, just the audio and most calls come through better than my ATT cell phone unless the wifi is really boggy."
Skype,2012-05-30,2,Living in Spain I thought it would be the best way to stay in touch with family and friends in the UK but quite often we lose contact so many times that we give up.  It is seldom possible to be able to see each other and I have been really disappointed.

Jeg havde lidt problemer med at finde ud af det hele i starten ;) Men det irriterer mig llidt at man skal betale penge for ting, som jeg ellers synes burde være standartmuligheder /: Mobil app'en er heller ikke super optimal, da jeg har oplevet at den op til flere gange ikke kan finde én eneste af mine kontakter? og nogle gange logger til på af sig selv, uden at jeg har rørt eller brugt app'en i en måned.. yderst underligt!

Skype,2012-04-25,3,"I use Skype mainly for intercontinental calls. Whilst there are indoubted cost benefits the quality of the ""line"" (audio over IP) is often very poor with interference and or dropping of sound. If you want to save money - great!If you expect comparable quality to a phoneline - you might be disappointed!"
Skype,2012-04-21,N/A,"Skype crosses oceans, time zones and the restraints of expensive call charges. You can talk to someone on the opposite side of the globe face to face whenever you want at no cost."

Luckily, I caught it before they racked up too much, under $100, but despite all of my efforts I could not get in touch with any type of customer service from skype. I just wanted to make sure this would never happen again, but they obvsiouly had no interest in helping their customers, even when they are the victim. I will never use skype again for this reason. I cannot trust a company that will allow my information to be hacked and then provide no customer service to console me."
Skype,2012-03-28,3,"Most used phone company. Calls to Cuba are very expensive. Please lower your rates to Cuba and offer monthly rates. Customer service is simply unacceptable. I was overcharged for several calls, asked to adjust, received no reply."

Life is GREAT!  Skype is GREAT!

Skype,2012-03-17,N/A,"Skype virker virkelig godt, når du har adgang til WiFi, gratis telefoni.Skype to go, ka' ikke anbefales, det koster normal roamingpris uanset om du ringer inden for samme land.Testet ml. Ballerup og bagsværd, ca. 8 km., ca. kr. 3,26 pr. minut og du skal forudbetale omkring kr. 90,- hvoraf der er kr. 82,- tilbage at ringe for.Måske har jeg ikke fundet ud af teknikken, for der reklameres ellers med noget lavere pris."

The telephone of course is far too expensive, but SKYPE.COM gave us the perfect means of seeing our family grow up. I really can't say enough just how happy I am to have been shown this lovely lovely site."
Skype,2012-03-04,N/A,"I use it every day because of its quick and perfect text and voice communication with friends, allowing to send files and links with the text. I like to see, if a friend is online now. You also can help friends by viewing on their desktop about Skype. This Screen Sharing feature (only in the newer Skype versions since version 4.1) is a similar function as the professional tool TeamViewer offers for this purpose."

Skype,2012-02-21,5,"Great Company! I recommended them to my Son.I bought an ionizer from life ionizers about 3 years ago. I liked the fact that they customized my filtration system and the water has done wonders for my health. At 62 years of age I appreciate things that optimize my health and well being. I called up to get new filters and they told me how to maintain my machine, which was great. The good deal was that 3 years after I bought my machine they sent me a free one year membership in their alkaline lifestyle health community. Great information on having a healthier lifestyle!"
Skype,2012-02-21,5,I can see my grandchildren on the other side of the world grow up
Skype,2012-02-19,N/A,Wonderful VOIP service for international calls.  But MMS way too slow and uses too much band width for good video calls.

Skype,2012-02-19,N/A,"I swear by Skype especially if we are talking about long distance love affair. This site helped my son maintained his 10 years long distance relationship with his girlfriend who happened to be living in the U.S. He didn't have a  US Visa so he couldn't visit her. Everyday since skype came into the picture, he get to see her and talk to her. Last December, they finally tied the knot. Both are now in the US. THANK YOu Skype!"
Skype,2012-02-19,5,Skype gives me the ability to speak with my friends in other countries without spending 900$'s for the phonecall - it allows you to maintain your connection without charging you an arm and a leg.

Skype,2012-02-16,N/A,"Min mand arbejder i udlandet og det er skide dyrt at ringe hjem fra almindelig telefon eller mobil. Siden skype blev instaleret på vores pc er livet bare blevet lettere og mere udholdeligt at være væk fra hinanden så længe af gangen. Tænk at noget så fedt er GRATIS..  Det kan ganske enkelt kun anbefales."

Skype,2012-02-14,N/A,"Skype, although I don use it much, is a great tool to maintain communication with distant people, business, friendship or pleasure. But in order to maintain that communication in desirable level, they need to improve it, because the laggines ruins it on video calls, even if you have great cam and internet speed. Other than that it does what it says most of the time."
Skype,2012-02-13,N/A,"great opportunity to speak to anyone in the world for freegreat"
Skype,2012-02-12,3,"Most incoming calls never ring on the iPhone 4S, don't even notify but go straight to voicemail. Competing products like Viber work like a charm for both incoming and outgoing calls."
Skype,2012-02-11,5,I love Skype. I've started using it for business as well now with one of the online numbers and it's saved me a lot of money.
Skype,2012-02-11,3,"entwickelt sich Skype in Richting Malware. Immer wieder will Skype - ohne Nachfrage - laufend neue Versionen, die technisch KEINESWEGS BESSER sind, updaten. Ich kenne keine andere Software, bei der man automatische Updates nicht verhindern kann. Wenn ich via volumen-bezahltem 3G Zugang im net bin, kostet mich das laufend unnoetig Geld. Ich bin zu Skype 3.8 zurueckgekehrt aus 3 Gruenden: 1) Man kann die updates abschalten. 2) Bei langsamem Internet ist die Videoqualitaet deutlich besser, da keine Bandbreite fuer Werbung und Add-Ons verbraucht wird. 3) Es gibt die SkypeMe Funktion, die bei spaeteren Versionen nicht mehr enthalten ist."
Skype,2012-02-10,N/A,excellent service and fast delivery
Skype,2012-02-09,3,The layout of the latest version of Skype is so wasteful of screen space it's almost impossible to use on a laptop.

Skype,2012-02-08,5,"Easy to download, install and set-up. Great for chatting to family and friends abroad or in other parts of the country.  All you need is a web cam and a mike.  Couldn't be easier!"
Skype,2012-02-08,4,"Works really well for face to face calls. iPhone FaceTime is probably better quality image but no good if the other person doesn't have an Apple product like iPhone or iPad! Fantastic when you're in another continent since you can load up credit and call to a land line back home at much lower rates.  You can even set it up so that your own phone number appears when you call that person back home."
Skype,2012-02-08,N/A,The best service for cheap calls.
Skype,2012-02-08,5,"Skype is very helpful service anywhere, at home, at hotel, in airport. If you can't live without contacts with your friends, parents or children s, this program for you.

Skype,2012-02-05,5,"Skype has changed by life in so many ways, it's a great service and is very cheap. I have a world subscription and I can make calls to telephones in most countries of the world for free.. I could never have dreamed of this just a few years ago.   Thank you skype, you changed the world for me."
Skype,2012-02-04,5,It helps us so much when we are abroad then we can communicate every day on phone calls.
Skype,2022-07-08,5,Now all good. So changed my rating to 5 star
Skype,2012-02-03,5,"It's a great site, where you can find whatever you need, contact the seller, solve problems . I've hused it more than 200 times... it's a pitty that the sites of ecommerce  developed locally here can´t achieve even a half of the quality of ebay..."
Skype,2012-02-02,3,Skype is still the best option for overseas calling however they continue to struggle with consistent audio and video feeds. You would think by now they would have figured it out.
Skype,2012-02-02,5,great way to keep in touch with friends
Skype,2012-02-01,4,Would be perfect if they built a good web application (to bypass my company firewall that doesn't let me install new software).
Skype,2012-01-31,5,"ho riscontrato che alcune volte, anzi più volte addebitano telefonate non effettuate; basta poco per far scendere ilcredito."
Skype,2012-01-31,5,"We used to phone the USA and had a deal with BT. But our friends said get on Skype, I was talked through it and found it easy to set up. YOU DO NOT NEED A CAMERA as someone in the computer magazines insisted you did. We already had a mic and speakers. So set up was easy. I have told others about the site and the options they give you, including the option to FREE calls to the states via the internet. Most modern laptops already are set up for Skype, so there's no need to buy extra items. We saw the snow from their house as moving the laptop around you can broadcast to others. Skype gives you eyes on the world."
Skype,2012-01-30,N/A,"I love using it to talk to people that are far away, but as soon as I reach around an hour of talking to someone, it always seems to drop the call."

Opkald både med og uden video virker som regel fint alt efter båndbredde forstås. Noget, jeg er ret utilfreds med og som gør, at jeg ikke bruger message-delen så meget mere er, at beskeder kan ""hænge"" i dagevis uden at blive leveret og pludselig får man så en besked som var aktuel flere dage før, selvom begge parter var logget på jævnligt uden andre problemer med forbindelsen."

Skype,2011-11-15,5,"I first discovered Skype about 4 years ago and signed up when line rental cost more than my phonecalls! Skype has allowed me to see my family from the other side of the world, show them round my new house, introduce the ""grandchild"" - our Malamute and take part in a Christmas Eve tradition I would have otherwise missed.The services offered, the quality of the connections and the fact that mostly it's free is awesome!Thanks for getting us together Skype - nice one!"

Skype,2011-11-07,5,Been using Skype for a couple of months and have been much more impressed than I expected to be
Skype,2011-11-07,3,I don't know what it is with this service but since Microsoft took over it has been consistently on the decline. i have more dropped calls than ever before and sometimes the service just doesn't connect. i use skype for business calls and it makes me look bad when i keep dropping clients and associates in mid call.

Skype,2011-09-22,5,"Best invention ever. No more paying £££s for calls abroad... I don't even know why people still use phones and calling cards to call abroad, I swear it's cheaper to just get internet access and a PC for whomever you're calling and just hooking up on Skype!"

Skype,2011-04-06,1,"Jeg skriver en meget kort, men præcis beskrivelse af mit problem med skype. Jeg får et svar der virker mere end computergeneret og som ikke på nogen måde adresserer de problemer jeg har. Men svaret er langt og har helt tydeligt til formål at forvirre mere end det gavner."

Skype,2010-07-22,N/A,"ind i mellem falder lyden ud, men det er efterhånden sjældent. Ellers god alternativt til samtaler til udlandet. Eneste minus er at der er krav om aktivitet på kontoen da skype ellers sletter de penge du har indsat. Det er tilgengæld også et stort minus."
Skype,2010-07-14,N/A,"Jeg elsker skype, det er den nemmeste måde at holde kontakten ved lige med vennerne, eller bare snakke med vennerne, brug skype og alting vil blive meget lettere... skype.dk/skype.com er som man nok ved samme firma, så denne anmeldelse gæller for begge hjemmesider."
Skype,2010-05-27,1,"Skype er et fantastisk telefon system, specielt for os der har bopæl i flere lande. Men som alle computerbasere systemer er det fejlbehæftiget. Men det behøver ikke være noget problem. Men desværre har jeg som Skype kunde opleve store tab ved opgradering. Er du glad for dette system, så følg følgende råd: Ingen opgradering før du har opbrugt al din kredit. Så mister du ikke noget når det går galt. Går det galt mister du al din kredit, jeg har mistet omkring 80 Euro. Jeg havde forudbetalt ""online number"" eller ""Skype In"" i to år plus en del Skype in kredit som del af pakkeløsninger. Ved opgradering fra Plus til World Wide abonnement mistede jeg min Skype In kredit. En række henvendelser har været resultatløse. De svar jeg har modtaget virker computergenererede og har til formål at afvise min klage. Da jeg har kunnet fremsende en lang liste, der viser mine Skype In erhvervelser der rækker langt frem i tiden, virker svarene fra Skype som ""Goddag mand Økseskaft"". Mit Skype In nummer blev lukket.Jeg har besluttet at bruge min Skype kredit op. Derefter opretter jeg et abonnement hos Lebare til mine mange og lange samtaler med udlandet og Skype vil jeg fremover kun bruge til de funktioner der er gratis.På min hustrus og mine egne vegne Jan Mortensen"
Skype,2010-05-19,N/A,Der er ingen kommentar - bare bliv ved med det i laver nu! Det er så godt.

Skype,2009-02-24,5,"Fantastisk billigt. Fantastisk hurtigt.  Virker ALTID"
Skype,2009-01-26,2,"Jeg har ikke kunne modtage SkypeIn voicemails, siden jeg købte et sæt RTX Dualphones i august sidste år. Kundeservice har været venlig og elskværdig, omend til tider meget længe om at svare, men Skype har efter snart et halvt stadig ikke løst problemet. Er ellers OK tilfreds. Men det er simpelthen for useriøst, at de ikke kan levere en så basal tjeneste - som jeg i øvrigt betaler for via mit abonnement - efter så lang tid."
Skype,2009-01-08,1,"Ok, produkt savner noget lydmæssigt men bevæger man sig ud i kundeservice så skriger det simpelthen til himlen. Jeg havde et enkelt lille spørgsmål til hvordan en service jeg havde købt hos dem fungerede, kunne ikke finde hjælp på skype.com, skrev til dem og har fået de VÆRSTE mekaniserede svar hvor de skyder skylden på en 3. part leverandør og det er slet ikke det sagen drejer sig om. Det er ikke det merchandise jeg har købt, men den service jeg har købt jeg bare ikke forstår hvordan fungerer. Vi er nu på 5. mail, men jeg har opgivet og må indse at det års abonnemnet jeg har købt nok ikke kan bruges KØB INTET hos SKYPE for der er ingen hjælp at få hvis ikke det virker."
Skype,2008-11-25,N/A,"Jeg har brugt Skype i mange år  og sparet mange penge på at kommunikere med hele verden.Mit eneste problem er at når man er på en trådløs forbindelse så kan det være svært at høre hvad der bliver sagt.Til gengæld sparer man utroligt mange penge ved at undvære telefonen til og fra udlandet!"
Skype,2007-09-19,N/A,"Jeg har købt to trådløse telefoner, masser af SkypeOut, SkypeIn og SkypePro. At SkypeIn-numre leveres af konkurrenten TDC har givet lidt støj, men TDC er ved vist at slukke for deres ""julenumre"", hvor de ""kommer til"" at slukke for strømme til SkypeIn-numrene... Bedste hilsener: -casper"
