Good Hombres,4,2019-04-16,"This place is never open when we want to go - they take a small break in the middle of the day and close, and that's always when we've been in the area. (I personally hate when restaurants do this, and prefer either they are open straight through or take a long break dividing lunch and dinner..that's a discussion for another day) Finally we made it one Saturday! They are also closed Sundays ...

Place was empty when we walked in but within literally five minutes it was completely full. We shared the haddock, pork w pineapple and asked for recommendation for the third taco and the cashier suggested shredded chicken. I asked for no cilantro which was respected. Quesadillas weren't available which was disappointing. 

Seating is all bar style/backless - not a problem for me yet but may turn out to be as I become a larger-pregnant person. The tacos were a good size and worked well for sharing. they all had the same sauce on top so the flavour profiles weren't extremely varied. I found the additional toppings in the tacos a little boring - it was mostly meat, tortilla (which was quite good) and the sauce - for instance the haddock could have used a tangy addition besides the small lime wedge.

I would have given this three stars but hubby gave it five, so in Yelp fairness I averaged our experience out.",2
Mexico Lindo,4,2019-04-15,"I have driven by this plaza several times, yet I never noticed this small Mexican restaurant until a friend suggested it.

There are only a handful of tables and I noticed they do a lot of take-out orders.  The menus are on chalkboards so it is very easy to read.  We ordered at the cash register, and then found a seat.  We were given complimentary tortilla chips and homemade salsa, which was a nice start.  We ordered two of the Mexican Combos, which consists of one beef chimichanga, one chicken enchilada, rice, salad and beans.  The food was very authentic and fresh.  I thought the beef would have been chunks rather than ground beef though.  My bad for not asking.  

The real star of the meal for me was the horchata.  I have not had once since our vacation in Mexico.  The drink was refreshing, delicious, and very creamy, with the right balance of rice, almonds, various milks and cinnamon.  It is very filling though!  I would definitely order it again.  

I was beyond full, but being a dessert lover, I had to try the caramel flan.  I should have taken it to go, but it looked so delicious.  Mexico Lindo's version is quite different.  The flan is very firm, not jiggly wiggly, and big on flavor!  My husband had only one bite, which is just as well.  I managed to finish it all by myself.

The owner came over and chatted with us, and it is nice to see a family put so much passion into what they do.  

Mexican Combo - $11.95
Horachata - $3.50
Caramel Flan - $6.00",2
Nodo Restaurant,2,2019-08-30,"New owner!!
Was my favourite place in the hood but noticed that the owner ship has changed and quality of the food has deteriorated. 
Less food and high priced.",0
Agio,5,2019-08-06,"We had the lobster pasta special and the salmon fillet with pumpkin seed crust tonight. Absolutely excellent. 

As it was our anniversary, the owner/chef gave us (my spouse) a lovely serving of tiramisu served in a martini glass. Nice.

This is definitely a local restaurant where food is treated in a special and personal way.",2
Mi Taco Taqueria,5,2018-08-28,"This place is easy to miss. It's almost a hole in the wall along Queen St, but once you step in, you'll be very happy that you did.

There's a good assortment of tacos and burritos here. Due to my carnivorous nature, I got the carne asada, beef brisket, and chicken tinga tacos. The toppings complement the tacos perfectly, and the end result is a flavour explosion once you bite into the taco. You know it's good when juice is dripping all over your hand and onto the tray. The flour tortilla is made in-house and is marvelous.

The chips and guac were also awesome and were a perfect ending to an excellent meal. Customer service here is also 5-star, so your entire dining experience will be great.",2
Trattoria Taverniti,3,2020-02-15,"In a word, mediocre ! Always a hit or miss. Cramped ,over priced and not overly well trained servers. Stick to the basics when ordering & pass on the deserts. Try this place , you may get lucky but it's always a gamble. Sometimes it pays off , sometimes bust....",1
La Chingada,4,2019-04-21,"Service was excellent, one woman was serving the whole place and she did an amazing job. Kudos to her!

Space is nice, tables far apart, two levels. Definitely have to dock points for the bathrooms. The women washroom stalls swing inwards, and with the placement of the toilet paper dispenser and the toilet, I could barely get my pregnant belly into the stall, so I can't imagine if you're a larger woman or a more-pregnant person...not very accessible.  

We had the queso, which was really delicious, but sadly only came with three tortillas - the Jen Agg rule is to not be a dick and give a number divisible by the group at the table (so we should have gotten 4). I have to agree. 

The pork huaraches was the star and I highly recommend it. The ""weak sauce"" served on the side was right up my alley. I didn't love the fish taco, and the chicken taco was pretty good. However, the tortillas were really well made and delicious, and the variance of flavours between all items means I'd definitely be back to try some other things and get more huaraches.",2
Ha Gow Dim Sum House,4,2018-03-22,"Dim Sum is definitely 4.5, excellent taste and I highly recommend the Steamed Bean Curd Skin Roll/Meat with Japanese mushroom and the steamed spare ribs. The reason why I have not rated it a 5 Star is because of the ambiance. It's a little small and a cash only establishment. Otherwise, you can't go wrong with the food.",2
98 Aroma,3,2017-09-01,"5/5 venue. Super clean (even the washrooms) for a Chinatown establishment and beautiful interior design -- traditional Beijing palace style! Super cool place to take a date or someone not so familiar with the Chinese culture for an ""authentic"" experience.......

But 3/5 food. Why? No major flaws with taste or quality, but unfortunately the dishes are just kind of boring. The regional cuisine served here is northeastern Chinese, which is my specialty since I hail from Shandong, as do the owner and some of the staff! I find the dishes very clean in that I feel that 98 Aroma uses less corn starch, oil, sodium, and possibly MSG than many other Chinatown restaurants.

3/5 value. Portion sizes are reasonable, but don't expect anything huge that would last for a week for under $10 like at House of Gourmet, etc. Pricier than most Chinese restaurants, but 98 Aroma can get away with this since they do have a swankier and more fusion feel. Think R&D, but with more Chinese-influence. A good place to take your Caucasian coworkers or in-laws, but not to dine alone just because. 

A few notes about specific dishes-

1. I've had the soups here before and the Hot & Sour soup is actually a huge portion even as a small size. The delicate mushrooms soup is not as substantial, so cannot stand alone as a meal.

2. Do order the Summer Breeze Veggie Salad (vegan) -- and make sure you MIX it well as all the sauce (and flavor) is at the bottom of the bowl. $9.99. Big portion, enough to share between 2 people or have as a lighter meal. I loved the textures and glass noodles.

3. Very mediocre Assorted Delicate Veggies (vegan). Broccoli, celery, carrots, and fried tofu. $14.99. Way too basic.

4. My gfs had the scallion pancakes, which looked more cooked and crispier than the ones my mom makes at home, but gfs enjoyed these. 

5. Can't remember the menu name, but gfs ordered a huge ass chicken udon stew, which was massive. They really liked the chicken and flavors here. 

6. Fried green beans with minced beef -- beans were oily and gfs weren't a fan. $13.99.

They take credit, debit cards at no extra charge. We didn't make a reservation for 7PM on a Friday night and were seated immediately, so customer volume is definitely not as high as it used to be a year ago.

Overall, would return, but only with Chinese food novices or for a special occasion.",1
Banh Mi Boys,5,2019-08-18,"This is my favourite place to come for Asian inspired sandwiches whenever I'm in Toronto. I love all the different meat choices they offer. I love their lemongrass chicken sandwich and kimchi fries which are to die for. Everything is simple and the ingredients are always fresh. I really wish they would open a location in mississauga/oakville/ brampton area so I could be a regular.

Their prices are also very reasonable too so this gives them a perfect score in my eyes.",2
GB Hand-pulled Noodles,4,2019-11-01,Wanted to try this place for a while went today in the afternoon and it was insanely packed got a seat and the stool and we can see through the window the gentleman making noodles in front of our eyes. I got the thick noodle beef spicy large which was massive. The broth was super tasty and the chilli oil was spicy but not to spicy. The noodles were soft and not gummy the beef was perfectly cooked and not chewy. The soup came nice and hot. Overall a wonderful experience and also it wasn't to filling as well which was perfect,2
Zhangâ€™s Kitchen,3,2019-12-24,"Service is very good...friendly ambiance but I'm sorry, I just did not taste the authentic chinese food that I want.  Maybe they are just giving a modern twist but not for me.  Also, the meat are so thinly sliced for the price it should have more than that.  It just my taste and maybe some people will not agree.",1
Harmoney Chinese Restaurant,3,2018-07-10,"[FOOD] - 3.5/5
I was highly anticipating my lunch here since I rarely find authentic Xian restaurants (Northwestern Chinese cuisine) in Toronto. I ordered Xian dishes such as the Steamed Lamb Pita Soup, the Chinese burger (Stuffed Pita), and the Northwestern Cold Noodles. My favourite item was the pita soup. The broth was just rich and flavourful... it would go great on a cold winter day. The cold noodles were a super refreshing part of the meal. Lastly, the Chinese burger (with lamb filling) was pretty good as well. The outer bun was crispy, not too thick, and quite delicious. 

[SERVICE] - 4/5
Okay, so I only gave 4/5 because my boyfriend speaks Chinese and the lady also speaks Chinese. She was quite nice and accommodating. It would've been nice if they had more than one server and spoke English. My boyfriend had to translate for the table of 14 next to us who could hardly understand the server. 

[OVERALL] - 3/5
While the restaurant can seem demeaning and unfriendly to non-Chinese speakers, it is a great place to go for highly authentic Xian cuisine.",1
MEXITACO,2,2019-09-25,"This has been a regular lunch spot for me this past year though I won't be returning . 

Last visit lunch two other tables only 2 waiters .

Wine ordered was old and smelled like vinegar.

Ordered apps nachos with guacamole and beans .

Both bowls for dips were still wet and beans tasted like dish soap .

Ordered water with ice did not ever arrive . Taco was okay but not what it used to be .

Cheese in a taco being extra at a Mexican restaurant is wired to me as well .

I wish they kept the same service quality as when they opened . 

We won't be going back .",0
La Carnita,3,2020-01-07,"3.5 stars!

I came here for a pitcher of sangria while I waited for DaiLo to open for dinner service. The staff wasn't the most welcoming and the sangria tasted like straight-up soda. I can't really speak to the food since I wasn't planning on dining here but people poured in right at opening time so that must be a good sign. 

Maybe the food here is phenomenal but I wasn't obsessed with my bar experience. Just ok.",1
Artisan Plus,3,2019-08-12,"Tried out this newish place at bay and Dundas. The menu describes the food as northern Chinese and simple. While the ingredients are all fresh, I think they've taken the ""simple"" a bit too far. I tried the short-rib beef dish. The broth is basic and does not have much flavour. That said, the veggies were all fresh and delicious. Just needed a bit more flavour to kick the dish up a notch. 

Decor-wise, the place is hip and modern. Staff are all very friendly and can explain the dishes. Food comes out fast. May try this place again and try a different dish",1
Hacienda las AmÃ©ricas,3,2020-02-23,"3.5/5 
The food is alright and authentic, prices are reasonable for the area and the service is friendly. The guacamole is made fresh to order so that's always a plus! I ordered 3 different taco flavours (steak, pork and fish) and preferred the steak fajitas tacos the best as it was super juicy. Wish there was some type of small side that accompanied the meal.",1
7 Numbers Restaurant,5,2019-06-30,"Authentic south Italian restaurant. The food was cooked by a grandma.

We are a group of 4 came here for a testing menu. $40 person. 4type of salad, 3 types of pasta and each person get their own entree.

The portion was very generous, after the pasta we have no room to eat the entree so we have to pack it to go. Service was excellent, food was excellent.",2
Banh Mi Boys,4,2019-06-26,"Banh Mi Boys was our first stop for food in Toronto. We waited in a line and ordered the five spice pork belly banh mi, kimchi fries with pulled pork, mayo, kimchi, and green onion, and a tofu taco with cucumber, slaw, carrots, cilantro, and mayo. I thought the prices were maybe a little high for being considered ""$"" as listed in Yelp, but the prices were definitely still good. I would describe the food here as very American Asian fusion (and that's not necessarily a bad thing!). 

My husband enjoyed the banh mi, and we both were TOTALLY wowed by the kimchi fries. These are a must-order!!! They do not skimp at all on all the toppings, so it's really excellent value. I don't eat meat, but it was very easy to pick around the pulled pork, for the most part. The tofu taco was a little underwhelming, which is why I rated this place four stars instead of five. I'm assuming the tofu taco is not what they're known for. ;) It was definitely good, but there was very little flavor to it. The tofu was very plain. I think it would have been better if it had had kimchi!

I feel like I want to try this place again so I can try more items on the menu. I'm sure there might be a few outstanding dishes that I just didn't get the chance to try when I was here! We will definitely be back.",2
Mariachiâ€™s Restaurant,5,2018-03-10,"Very nice neighborhood Mexican restaurant.  Staff are very friendly (we were served by a young Mexican girl student) and the food was outstanding. Even my Venezuelan girlfriend was impressed!
We will go back there for sure.",2
MEXITACO,3,2019-11-10,"Been visiting this place since it was on Bloor, so I'm obviously a fan. 

The food is excellent, and continues to be so, with the exception of the guacamole. It's very smooth and soft, not chunky at all. I find it to be overly citrusy, with lack of garlic taste. Reminds me of store bought super bright green guacamole that never seems to go bad . Skip the guac, and just smash an avocado at home. Everything else I've tried here has been great (tacos, tostadas).

The service has never been amazing, but has declined significantly. On my last visit, we weren't given water until 20 minutes after we were seated. Cocktails took a whopping 30 minutes. It felt awkward and kinda embarassing to try to emphatically wave down the uninterested server. After food was brought out, we weren't checked on until, once again, I found myself waving down server for our bill.

Long story short, when I received the bill, I expressed my concern with the service. The explanation honestly pissed me off. They said the service is messed up because they have too many Uber eats orders. I told him you can't have Uber eats impacting your dine in patrons, but apparently you can. We live in a new world where restaurants can probably survive off of online orders. Either way, waiting 20 minutes for water isn't an Uber issue.",1
Ramen Isshin,3,2020-02-08,"Black Sesame Tan Tan:
Nice chewiness of the noodles, and it was very filling despite looking like a small portion. The fun part about this dish is you grind the black sesame and add it to your bowl as you desire! The black sesame added a very fragrant taste. This was a nice experience, however it was too salty for me (apparently a lot of things I eat are too salty for me though??? Something must be wrong with my taste buds). I tried my friends white sesame noodles and that was less salty, and the broth was more light and creamy. I would probably get that instead next time. Glad to finally be able to cross Ramen Isshin off my list",1
Eataly,3,2020-03-07,"A group of us went for dinner at La Piazza within Eataly. Note this restaurant's dishes are meant to be like tapas and a shared family style - about the size of appetizers. We ordered aranchini, marinated mackerel (scombro), a white (quattro formagi) and a red pizza (bufalo), spinach ricotta ravioli (quadrati), and the rainbow trout entree with fingerling potatoes. Our favorites were the quadrati (al dente with a flavorful creamy filling and lemony sauce to cut the richness), the aranchini (so creamy & cheesy!), and the rainbow trout which was cooked to perfection with a crispy skin. The scombro was very good as well. Extremely underwhelming was the pizza which we wouldn't recommend; the white cheese pizza was sparse on the cheese and very dry, and while the bufalo had more flavour due to the tomato sauce is was soggy/spongy. 

Service was excellent and attentive without being invasive - and our lovely server corrected an ordering error I made without fuss or hesitation when I accidentally ordered the wrong pizza. We were not charged for it which was really appreciated, given it was our first time there and an honest mistake. 

And the whole of Eataly is just fun to eat and shop your way through. Recommend for a great night out!",1
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria,3,2018-08-10,"Dimmi was ok but it wasn't anything special. My husband, daughter and I were in Toronto for a quick family vacation. After sight seeing we went to Yorkville to shop. Of course all of the shopping made us hungry. We walked up and down the street to find something to eat. We finally decided on Dimmi. I had a taste for pasta and thought this would be a good choice. It was pretty busy but there was no wait. The staff was very nice and accommodating.

When we first got there my husband and I ordered drinks. He got a Old-Fashioned and I got a Sangria. He enjoyed his drink. My drink started off good but then started to taste like medicine the more I drank it. Needless to say I didn't finish it.

We started our dinner with ordering the Kale as an appetizer. Of course this was a side salad. It consisted of shaved kale with pinenuts and cranberries covered with pecorino cheese in a lemon and olive oil dressing. This salad was very good. The flavors were nice and most of all I enjoyed the pinenuts. They added a nice crunch to the dish. 

For our entrees I ordered the STRO ZZAPRETI ALLA ERNESTO and my husband ordered the Roasted Chicken Breast. My dish consisted of spicy nduja sausage, rapini and cherry tomatoes in garlic and olive oil. This was something different for me but good. The sausage added a nice hint of heat but not too spicy. The pasta was good. It also had cherry tomatoes and spinach. I could have done without the spinach. I like spinach in salads or creamed spinach but I don't like plain cooked down spinach. The texture is odd in my opinion. Other than that this dish was good.  My husband's dish came with vegetables and roasted potatoes. The chicken was pretty tender but flavorless. The whole plate was flavorless for that matter. It was very bland and needed seasoning. My husband ate it but he wasn't thrilled. 

Last, we ended our meal with a dessert. We ordered the Apple Crumble. It came out in a slice but instead of pie crust topping it had a crumble topping. It came with a scoop of ice cream. This dish was decent. It was pretty tasty. It's one of those things that is wasn't bad but it wasn't the best we have had. 

Overall, Dimmi was ok. We enjoyed it but it wasn't anything special.",1
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,1,2020-05-24,"Ok, so I know this place is all the rage. 

I ordered the grilled beef for corona takeaway and I was disgusted. There was more fat, cartilage and inedible pieces than beef. Chew chew CRUNCH - spit. Over and over. My friend called me two hours later after ordering the same thing - she ended up giving her order to the homeless after the first bite. 

This means that they either don't clean (cut the meat) properly, or using cheaper pieces to save a buck. 

The grilled chicken was dry too. Honestly though, the shrimp was good. Stick to pulled beef and chicken for authenticity and - TEXTURE. C'mon seven lives!

Very disappointed.",0
Fudao noodle house,3,2019-08-18,"I think I ordered the wrong broth here. I probably would have enjoyed my meal much more but the broth was overpowering, a lot more pungent than I'm used to. But I powered through it and it ended up being good. So point is, don't get the pickled vegetable with pork broth unless you know what you're getting into! I wish I could come here to try more soups. I love the concept: Piping hot soup still boiling as you dip the veggie and other condiments in. Add a few slices of pork and then the noodles as your last bet. Very presentable and affordable!",1
Zhangâ€™s Kitchen,5,2020-03-06,Delicious braised beef brisket with rice (large).   Soaks up the sauce nicely.  4 different spice levels. I choose Mild.  $15.99 for a large.  Amazing lunch for a cold winter day.  Clean restaurant.,2
El Trompo Taco Bar,2,2019-05-20,"I'm very confused on the tacos we received vs all these amazing reviews...

First timers at Kensington so we decide on this taco joint because Seven Lives was too long around 1:30p. 5 small tacos come in an order and you can only mix and match Al Pastor, Tinga and Chorizo. So we decided to get 2 Tinga and 3 Al Pastor. The tacos literally came out in 2 minutes after ordering. Too quick :3 The taste was bland and unappealing.

I've just attributing this negative review to a bad day at El Trompo...",0
Tacos El Asador,1,2020-04-24,"Ordered beef burrito and pork pupusas through ubereats.
Started with the burrito which was bland and barely any beef/protein. I couldn't even finish the burrito because it was so bad and I decided to try the pupusas.
It was hard by the time I got to it. Think twice before ordering...",0
Campechano TaquerÃ­a,3,2018-08-04,"Delicious tacos, horrible sangria. 

Campechano and Seven Lions are the only two ""authentic"" tacos I've had in Toronto, as compared to tacos you can get in the US, particularly as you get close to the Mexican border. At $6-$8 each, they're not cheap, and you'll need between 2-4 to fill you up. 

Avoid the sangria - one of the worst I've had in Toronto.",1
Eataly,3,2020-03-18,"This place is definitely overrated and way too crowded.

You'll have to wait over an hour to get seated at one of the restaurants and although the food is more affordable than most Italian restaurants in the city, the wait isn't worth it.

If you go, just grab a few slices of the pizza from the  counter along with a bottle of wine, grab a seat and enjoy that.

I'll only be going back to get cheeses and cold cuts from the market ad this was exceptional.",1
El Charro,3,2019-09-30,The quality is quite good but even after $15-20 you will leave hungry because the portions are way too small,1
Fieramosca,3,2016-07-03,"You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both and there you have the facts of life... at Fieramosca.  (You are old like me if you know that theme song!)

Have you ever gone to a restaurant with great expectations based on reviews and left disappointed?  That was our experience.

Some call it cozy but for me the table layout in the main dining room is claustrophobically cramped.  If you want a seat on the patio on Friday or Saturday in the summer, make sure to reserve several days in advance.

Reservations are taken by phone and I will admit they were very helpful even if it did take 10 rings for them to answer... I was surprised that a restaurant in this price range did not have online reservations!

Being in a house transformed into a restaurant, the entry hallway is narrow, so if someone is going out, nobody can go in and vice versa.  

So if you are even a little claustrophobic,  be warned, you won't be comfortable here.  

The food:

Complimentary bruschetta:  A plain Pizza crust with bruschetta topping which falls off and wasn't that flavourful. Go to La Bruschetta to find out how it is meant to taste.

Caesar salad:  Crispy romaine, hints of fresh garlic and Parmesan but the dressing seemed watery and the croutons were like rocks.

Bread basket:  Now I know why the croutons are like rocks, the crust on the bread was so hard I was worried I would break a tooth, and I also found it strange to be served whole wheat bread, when I was expecting crusty Italian bread.  

Spaghetti Carbonara:   The reason we came was because Hubby was craving Carbonara and based on great reviews we thought we would try it here but he found Fieramosca's version disappointingly bland, even with extra Parmesan cheese and fresh ground pepper.  

Linguini DI Mamma Ninetta:  I love mushrooms but was surprised that there were so many in this dish... With just 3 small shrimp and a few small pieces of chicken scattered throughout, and very little garlic flavour, this dish was edible but far from great.

Tiramisu:  No coffee flavour!  I have made Tiramisu before and have had it in countless restaurants and I know the lady fingers are to be dipped in coffee before being covered in cream, and these missed the coffee altogether, and the cream here seemed to just be whipped cream, none of the yummy marscapone that I was expecting.   Libretto's Tiramisu in a jar might not be traditional in presentation but has all the flavour that Fieramosca's lacked.  My favourite dessert when done well, I left disappointed.

Lemon Sorbet:  Frozen sorbet in a scooped out lemon, menu says imported from Italy.  I actually liked it better than the sad face Tiramisu so hubby swapped with me because while he usually loves anything lemon, he found an odd aftertaste.  I joked it was the jet fumes to bring frozen sorbet from Italy but the truth is, it was the perfume worn by the woman at the table next to ours.  Thankfully she arrived as we had dessert, so our entire meal was not ruined, but the smell was so overpowering that it gave us both a headache and we wanted to get out of there fast, since with the cramped layout she was almost on top of our table.

Ladies, please don't drown yourself in perfume and go to a restaurant!  Ugh!

TL;DR - Meh. Bottom line nothing was horrible but nothing was great, which for the price was disappointing.  Not worth a second visit.

2 stars bumped to 3 because the service was good.

The search for Pasta Carbonara continues... maybe a trip to NYC or even Rome!",1

OVERALL: 5/5
SERVICE: 5/5
FOOD: 5/5

this was incredible!!  my first time having mexican food not from a franchise. the portions were huuuge lol, i could probably order one meal for two people. & it tastes wonderful. i was worried everything would be too salty, but it wasn't! yay!

at this time (covid-19), they are offering takeout or delivery. i placed my order through ubereats.

CHIMICHANGA: this was my favourite thing i ordered from them. fried to perfection. i ordered it vegetarian, and it had corn, peppers, zucchini, i don't remember the rest lol. but wow! & it comes with three sauces, i loved it paired with sour cream

QUESADILLA: a bit on the salty side, but that is as expected with the cheese haha. again, ordered it as a veggie, i think same toppings as the chimichanga

SIDES (BEANS, SALAD, RICE): each order came with a all three sides! my favourite side was definitely the salad. it was soooo good haha

CHURROS: oh these were fried to perfection, coated evenly, and the sauces were great!! great sweet to finish off the meal",2
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine,5,2020-03-20,"You can truly taste the difference in quality of dim sof Dynasty compare to other dim sum places downtown Toronto.  The dishes are flavourful and fresh.  I highly recommend calling in to reserve a table, otherwise expect to wait 20-30 mins for one.  The only downside is that customer service isnt so great.  Once you place your order, your food will come when dishes are ready.  The waiters will not come check up on you. Ive noticed this when it is a full house of customers.",2
House of Gourmet,3,2019-10-11,"Good for assisting in the time of need.....HANGOVERS.

These guys are open and you can order before 4pm unlike some nasty places who don't care about my suffering.

The food is very reasonably priced and pretty good too, a usual is the beef in black bean sauce which is solid and very filling...on the other hand the fried rice dishes are not the greatest and can lack a lot of flavor.

Good place just be sure what your ordering is something powerful in flavor as the more subtle options generally tend to fail.",1
GB Hand-pulled Noodles,4,2019-11-15,"This place is uber busy during the lunch rush, there's usually a line, though it does move pretty fast. It was also very cramped inside and difficult to maneuver without bumping into ppl. Other than that, this place had a solid bowl of beef noodles.

Juicy Dumpling,5,2020-01-11,"I can not stress how much i love this place enough! Located on dundas and spadina in dragon city mall, this place is a hidden gem!

Dumplings are one of my go to snacks or quick meals and i really like the takeout joint concept. It's an ideal place to grab a quick meal in-between classes whenever i have a long day.

The dumplings are so good, so fresh! My childhood favourite is the steamed xiao long bao and it still is today, and this place serves one of the best ones i've had in downtown toronto. I've also tried the pan fried soup dumplings (basically xiao long bao with a pan-fried bottom) and loved them! I've been wanting to try more items from the menu but whenever I go here i always end up getting the xiao long bao for some reason.

They also have a wide range of sauces on the side so you can choose whatever you want to dip your dumplings in. Some of the condiments they provide are vinegar, soy sauce, and sriracha.

I also need to talk about the price. When i first went here, i was honestly so surprised when i saw the prices! They're super affordable (2.99 for 6 xiao long baos), which is a REALLY good deal especially in downtown toronto.",2

La Carnita,3,2019-09-22,"I'll start off by saying that I firmly believe that people come here for the atmosphere. It's a great place to just hang out, enjoy the music, and the drinks ! The taco's aren't the best I've ever had...nor are they the worst tacos either. You're paying almost $6 for ONE little TINY sample sized taco. So you don't get your money's worth at all.  They have quite a bit of options to choose from when it comes to tacos which is actually a pro to this place( except for when some options are sold out..). A huge con to me would be the fact that some of my tacos were cold by the time it got to me.. another huge con would be the service. Considering that there were literally 4 customers seated you would have expected them to be a lot more attentive, but that wasn't the case. Anyways the chances of me returning to eat are extremely low. Might just stop in to have a drink if I'm ever in the area though...HOWEVER if you do decide to give this place a try..  go for the shrimp taco ! 

$60 dollars later... stomach was still growling and I had to head over to McDonalds. ...",1

Buca Yorkville,5,2019-05-31,"TL;DR Upscale delicious Italian seafood

After trying the other Buca restaurants (which were fantastic), we were not disappointed by Buca Yorkville and can totally see why this place is rated in the top 5 for Canada's Top 100 Restaurants. Its quality and flavours are on par with other top-notch restaurants in Canada. 

Spot prawn crudo 5/5 - started with spot prawn freshly flown in just a few hours before. You can taste how fresh it is with its sweet notes and tender meat. It is absolutely divine.

Nodini 5/5 - One of our favourite classic dishes from Buca. The bread knots are small spheres fried with light salt and garlic. 

Nnocco fritto (squid ink dumplings withÂ tuna n'duja)Â 5/5 - this was our FAVOURITE dish of the night. We had no idea what it us and took Yelp's recommendation for it. It came with 6 little pockets of bread that you can stuff with spicy tuna and n'duja. The flavour and texture was incredible. Definitely give this a try. 

polipo e vongole 3/5 - this octopus dish is where things fell flat for us. The octopus was cooked with clams and bone marrow. Both the clamps, bone marrow, and stock were delicious and rich in flavour. However, the octopus itself lacked flavour and char. When you bite into the meat, there was no chew or tenderness, felt very mushy and bland. 

Bigoli 5/5 - our second time order the duck egg pasta. This is a must try when you come to the restaurant. The noodles are perfectly al dente and coated in duck offal ragu. If you're weirded out by innards, do not fret as you do not taste the gameyness at all. The sauce is rich and rounded.",2
Carisma,1,2019-10-20,"- Not worth for its price. Both service and quality of food. 
- Pappardelle very hard not fully cooked
- Risotto hard as well 
- In this city when there are so many Italian restaurants to compete with, this type of quality simply unacceptable. 
- The lady who served us seemed very unhappy and no smile during the whole dining period.  At the end of the mains, she wiped the dinning table but did such a sloppy job that all crumbles fell on my lap.  I do not know the purpose of doing it. 
- the ""supervisor"" or the manager walked around the room and consciously or subconsciously patted our velvet lounge chair to tell us hurry up cause we might have chatted too long and eating too slow.  
Overall, we are a group of three and we picked this place for our Japanese friend's visit for our first time. None of us would return again.  Pure disappointment.",0
Stelvio,3,2020-02-14,"meeeeeeh.... I really wasn't all that impressed with this place. 

The decor and service were really good for sure. But the food was just OK. Considering how many amazing Italian restaurants there are in Toronto, I would not come back to this one. 

One thing that really surprised me was that the food was cold and didn't taste fresh. It sort of tasted like it had been reheated. 

The appetizers were fine but not amazing. The risotto, osso buco, and pasta did not live up to the hype -- just imo.",1
Ramen Isshin,3,2020-02-19,"3.5/5
With so many ramen joints in and around Toronto, this place is just another typical ramen joint. I'm really surprised to hear many say this is their favourite ramen.
Remember to join the yelp waitlist during busy hours but service is usually speedy with quick turnarounds in table. 
Approx. $15 per bowl, portions could be larger but there is the option to add extra noodles for a few dollars.",1
Mexico Lindo,2,2018-06-06,"This place has been bookmarked for awhile and I finally had the chance to try out this local restaurant located in Scarborough. This is a takeout and dine in restaurant - very casual.

After ordering at the counter, they offer complimentary chips and salsa. The salsa was so thin and watered down - no flavour whatsoever. I would have rather opted to not have it at all. 

I ordered the Chorizo Quesadilla which comes with beans, rice and salad. There are two sauces on dish but both were bland and lacking any taste. My sister ordered the Chicken Burrito which comes with the same sides, again it was bland and quite disappointing. I'm flabbergasted as to how this place has 4/5 stars when there are other places that taste so much better. Maybe it was an off day but this is not my first time having Mexican food. 

Sure the price is on point and portion is decent but quality and taste needs improvement. 

I'm sorry but I will not be returning.",0
El Trompo Taco Bar,3,2019-05-26,"2.5 stars but rounds up to 3. Okay tacos but nothing special. Al pastor was dry and lacked flavor.  Service was friendly and very quick (tacos came in less than 3 minutes after ordering).  Frozen margs we're good, though. 

Tinga Tacos: 3/5
Al Pastor Tacos: 2/5
Mango Margarita: 4/5",1
House of Gourmet,3,2019-10-08,"Spontaneous craving for Chinese food but wanting to give other restaurants a chance in Chinatown led me to House of Gourmet. 

Portions are on the smaller side and they were decent enough to satisfy cravings. Wasn't much of a wow factor in my opinion. Ordered Yeung Chow fried rice, sweet and sour pork, beef soya sauce noodles, turnip cakes and snow peas for a group of 4. Topped it off with a iced lemon tea each.",1
Ha Gow Dim Sum House,2,2019-09-24,"We were in the neighborhood and couldn't decide what to eat so we did what others would do in our situation which was to bust out our phones and go on Yelp for suggestions! Well Yelp led us to this place based on its high ratings but I'm sad to say that Yelp has failed me again.  This restaurant's dimsum quality was not good. The curry cuttlefish was very watery and bland, their chicken feet had a weird taste, their sui mai was okay but again kind of bland, their spare ribs was full of fat and the list goes on and on with negative things to say about their other dishes. None was good!

Service was okay but their debit machine was down and I didn't have cash on me and when I asked if they take e- transfers, they said no. So I had to drive out to a bank to get cash which was a bit of a pain but of well.

Definitely will not comes back to this one.",0
Swatow Restaurant,3,2019-11-24,"Clearly this place is very popular because there was a line out the door during prime time dinner. This disappointing part is the table set up. It's so packed. We couldn't get to our table without telling like two tables if they can move. In addition, we were very confused about the food options. We had to send our noodles back because it's not what we wanted. I asked to double check before that could happen  but I guess there was a miscommunication. Also i was not a fan of the chicken we ate. Tasted mainly like a lot of fat and breading. The second  pair of noodles we got were very delicious.
Overall I'm not the biggest fan of the service and the food. Except the Lo MEIN, those were good
Menu:
General Tao Chicken
Lo Mein Beef and Vegetables",1
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine,1,2018-11-13,It was way over priced for the type of food you get. One particular waiter was very rude (Tony). The other waiters were polite but the ratio of wait staff to patrons was not balanced. We had trouble just getting water or trying to get our bill.,0
Fieramosca,3,2018-06-19,"Had a good dinner here last week! The interior is very traditional Italian and very cozy. Restaurant seems to be in an old house. There is a back patio as well a terrace on the third floor but we didn't get to check those out. 

The meal started with warm bread, we also got a caprese salad which i thought was just okay (tomatoes and basil weren't super fresh). My main was pappardelle with tomato sauce, shrimp and mushrooms. The best thing about the dish was how hot it was when it came out! It stayed hot for the entire time I was eating it which was awesome. I also loved the sauce which tasted very fresh and tomato-ey. The shrimp itself was kind of a letdown - it was a little overcooked and they also had the tails on which made it a little awkward to eat. Additionally, there seemed to be a couple pieces of shrimp shell in the pasta - the first time I ate a piece I thought it was maybe a tail I hadn't put off to the side but when it happened again I realized it was a piece of shell. My partner had the carbonara pasta which he said was just okay. For dessert we had tiramisu, it was delicious and a good portion for sharing. The meal was a little pricey, but everything is in Yorkville.

The service could have been better. We spent some time waiting to give our order and also to get water, and when the server did come by he seemed to be in a hurry. My partner felt bad since we'd come in without a reservation, and he wondered if they needed the table - but if the restaurant didn't have room for us, it's their responsibility communicate that - either tell us they don't have a table available or that we need to leave by a certain time. (Neither of those things were mentioned when we were seated.) Our entire meal was just over an hour long so we certainly weren't taking an unusually long time to eat.

Overall the meal was fine but next time I'll probably try one of the other italian restaurants in the neighbourhood!",1
Hotopia Downtown,3,2019-12-12,"I've been here once before and had a good experience. The pickled cabbage beef soup was plentiful for two people and we had enough to EACH take home for a second meal. Everything was delicious and I craved it everyday until I went again. 

The second time, there was barely anything in the soup and they forgot the pickled cabbage...the pickled cabbage that's in the name! I brought it to a waiter's attention and she had the audacity to just bring it out in a bowl, did not offer for the kitchen to add it to the soup and recook it. Very disappointed. At checkout they did offer 10% off without me having to do anything, which was nice. But still. How do you forget one of main ingredients?!",1
Ho Ho Barbeque,3,2019-08-20,"Found this on Yelp and picked it cause it had a higher rating than the other shops all lined up serving the same thing!

There were only a few people in line for Ho Ho, but there was a line out the door a few shops down. Probably should've gone to the other place, but this one was ok.

Pork was ok. The skin was still crispy when we got back to the hotel. Duck wasn't anything special. Cha siu was ok. This w all about average for us, although I know our moms would say it wasn't good.

Next time, I'll have to try the other place with the longer line.",1
Bar Buca,3,2018-04-11,"Came here for brunch on Sunday and it was way off the mark. While the ambiance is nice, it was moderately loud and you may be asked to share a table with another group. That didn't bother us really -- the fail point was that they were out of so much stuff and the waitress didn't let us know before we spent a good ten minutes with the menu. No steak. Shoot.

The other failpoint was how their trout brunch menu item is basically like a few bits of fish and citrus. It's definitely not an entree and more of an appetizer. While the waitress did seem to communicate that a tad, I think we definitely expected something different.

The egg dish with the bread was pretty good and tasty and the winner, but portion-wise it also wasn't super filling, but the eggs were perfect. My goat meat focaccia sandwich was decent and tasty -- but I left the meal a bit hungry..I do think maybe we got unlucky with the amount of things they were out of and I do think the chef can cook...I just think the more appetizer-y items should be more clearly labeled and explained.",1
Artisan Plus,2,2019-12-31,"Tight seating area with not much space between tables, nor to put winter parkas. My friend's seat was more like a plastic stool. Not comfy at all. More of a eat and run place but your tummy might be hungry still. 

The service was good. We got three water refills from the bottle as it was small. 

My dish came out messy and the portion for $14 was small. There aren't enough veggies. The spicy taste was a good quick to it. The noodle looked like gnocchi and it was chewy. My friend's dish came later on as they messed up the order. She said it was ok. Again, one is paying the price for a small portion of food that wouldn't fill up one's stomach 

So definitely I was still hungry before heading to the theatre. 

Verdict- not sure where they are getting the high reviews but it's not worth my time. For $14 plus taxes and tips, I'll rather eat at a food court that would satisfy this Cat-Squirrel's tummy. Bring on the food!!",0
Artisan Plus,3,2019-08-23,"Another month has come and gone and here we are in the heart of Toronto just doing our thing. We've walked by Artisan Plus many time and we finally gave it a try. This place was buzzing with people around the lunch hour however the wait for a table for two wasn't very long. We waited may be 5 mins.

As this was our first visit we wanted to try a few of the appetizers and different noodles dishes. As such for the apps, we ordered the Artisan Pork Jia Mo which is handcraft artisan bread with chopped braised pork belly and gravy. The braised pork belly was quite tasty however it did get quite messy because of the gravy. We also tried the Shuan Tofu Sheet which was made of fresh tofu sheet mixed with bean sprouts, shredded red pepper, scallion, gourmet chilli, peanut and sesame sauce. This dish had the very slightest numbing spice. However this dish was slightly on the oily side and the tofu sheet were too long.

For our mains, I tried the Famous Yo Po Biang Mian which was ribbon noodle, sauteed tomato, scramble egg, cauliflower, potato, carrot, organic cloud ear mushroom, edamame, grilled zucchini, paparika, and vinegrette. The ribbon noodle was super long which made eating the noodle slightly difficult. However the flavours were different and interesting. Nothing that really made my taste buds dance. There was no numbing spice to this dish. However if you don't eat spicy on a regular basis I wouldn't recommend this dish. My husband tried the Wok Cumin Che Mian with Spring Lamb. Surprisingly the Lamb wasn't super gamey. Again the noodles were all super long and the flavour was okay. However, I still want to try their noodle soup one day. 

The service was on the ball. The waitress was always around in case you needed them. Than again the restaurant wasn't super large. There were probably around 40 seats.",1
MEXITACO,3,2019-02-11,"A few points:

We got:

-grilled fish tacos 
-bean/cheese quesadilla 
-chicken quesadilla 
-beef tacos
-beef burrito 
-fried plantain 
-churro
-4 beers/$10 Sunday deal

3 stars because the portions are on the small side for what you pay. One hungry person will need at least two orders of tacos plus a side to fill them up. Service was ok but seemed a bit disinterested. 

The churro was very very good. I recommend for desert. That was probably the dish that stood out the most. 

The venue itself is nicely designed and a cool hangout spot. I'm happy to have a place like this in the neighbourhood especially because there are not a ton of sit down Mexican restaurants in the east end. They definitely fill a niche. Food is fine but nothing to write home about. Worth a try but it won't knock you off your feet. You will be annoyed by the lack of parking but not much one can do about that.",1
La Vecchia Ristorante,1,2018-08-23,"This place has been on my list of must-try restaurants in the Yonge-Eg area for quite some time (mostly because of all the high Yelp reviews). However, I was pretty disappointed with my experience. Cleanliness is a really big deal to me, and the restaurant did not feel very clean. There were a LOT of flies buzzing around my table, to the point that I had to swat my hand in between every single bite and was afraid one would fly into my mouth (ew!). The bread was cold, and the pasta was mediocre and at a higher price point. The waiter could see me constantly waving my hand to get the flies out of my face and made no comment. I was not impressed.",0
Baretto Caffe,4,2018-09-12,"Completely hidden from the street as it's located inside a medical building.  Thank you for the Yelper who posted the photo of the actual building!  Otherwise, I would've missed it.  :)

Very, very close to a 5*!  The only reasons why it missed the mark was that the food took sometime after ordering, 20mins+.  And there was a missing ingredient in the Fantasia Salad - corn!  I didn't bother mentioning it 'cause we were soo hungry by the time the food arrived.

If you're looking for a quick meal, this is not the place for you.  Please allow some time to soak in the '80s Italo-Disco music and the owners kind demeanor!

Personally, if it were my first time, I'd order a caffeinated drink (good beans), pasta, pizza, panini, & pastry.  I'd skip the salads.  The Fantasia was good, but it's something that you can make at home.  LattÃ© was smooth and very, very good!

Pasta with rosÃ© sauce was DELICIOUS!  It arrived to the table piping hot and fresh tasting.  If you're not too hungry, it can definitely be shared btw 2 ppl as it also comes with some garlic bread + a side salad.

Owner was very nice, always checking in on us.  She was upbeat and always said, ""with pleasure"" and seemed to mean it!  There were some nice touches like providing us with place mats and glasses of water with ice.  Very warm atmosphere!

Too bad/thank God this place isn't located too close by.  Otherwise, it can be dangerous!",2

Playa Cabana,4,2019-08-31,"Food was exceptional and service was pretty fast. It's in a weird location tho only visited because it was about 10 minute walk from the ROM.
Only issues was the seating area was a bit small inside so you feel squished. But they have some more spots outside for when it's a nice day. I recommend to anyone who wants to try real authentic Mexican food. Everything tastes fresh and makes you want to order more.",2
La Vecchia Ristorante,3,2018-08-29,"My family and I decided to choose La Vecchia for my mini wedding dinner, as my cousin had recommended it to us so we decided to have a go and try it out. 

The place had a very nice atmosphere, very nice with cute decors. The food was pretty good, it was flavourful with a good portion size and at a reasonable price. 

Our server just seemed like he didn't want to be there. Maybe he was too busy? Or had a rough day? So I kept it positive, didn't mention anything until my other family members almost everyone noticed as well. It was my dinner night where as I was busy talking to my family members so I've missed when he was offering cheese to the pastas. I apologized and asked if he was able to bring the cheese back again, never came back with the cheese. Overall just got a very bad vibe. We had another younger server come by to collect our plates and he had a much better attitude and was certainly polite. 

I've also told the server if we could do the bill 4 ways, it was my fault I meant everyone to themselves and asked politely if he was able to change it. The response I got was ""no it has already been done and can't change it."" Left me with such a terrible feeling to my gut that now everyone overpaid for what they haven't ordered. It was my fault I'll take it but correct me if I'm wrong? The bill can't be redone? Anyways to the end of our dinner, the server all of a sudden became friendly as the bills were being handed out. 

It was certainly a day to remember, but to keep it positive I just let it go and remembered the good food and great conversations with my family members.",1
Sichuan Garden Restaurant,2,2018-08-17,"Sweet and sour soup was good. Dumplings were good.  Our meals were bleh. Had Tsao chicken, which looked very nice but was more deep fried pieces than chunks of chicken.  My spouse had chicken with ginger and scallions which he enjoyed. A friend had some beef dish that was indescribable.",0
Mexico Lindo,3,2015-02-11,Came here tonight for dinner tonight because of awesome experience last time.  It was pretty empty on a Wednesday evening.  The owners are really lovely and this is why I give it 3 stars.  The food is not what it was when I visited last. I really enjoy authentic Mexican food and unfortunately the food tonight lacked spice that I really enjoy.   The food was flavourful but not nearly as amazing as I remember.  I ordered my food spicy and they wasn't even the slightest tingle :(,1
Donatello Restaurant,4,2017-09-02,"From beginning to end a wonderful dining experience. The service was expert and unobtrusive, very attentive with several servers assigned to each table. The ceasar salad was very credible, better by far than most, followed next by one of the best Spaghetti Pescatore's I've had. The dish had mussels, manila clams, shrimp, calamari and scallops; there was no shortage of good quality fresh seafood. A very light tomato based sauce reduced with a seafood stock dressed the perfectly cooked aldenti pasta. A good quality Red Velvet cake is very hard to fine has been my experience not at Donatello there's is one for the ages. The restaurant has it all together, you will find that menu items are made fresh to order  so expect wait times to be longer but well worth the delay.",2
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,4,2019-09-25,"4 stars for taste
2 stars for price 
Which really should be a 3, but the meat is just so delicious. Coming from LA, I just don't think I can justify 6 CAD for ONE taco and one alone!! If you expect to be full, get ready to spend 20 CAD per person (and really that's like 3 tacos plus tax). 

With price aside, the taste is absolutely delicious. I tried the Pollo Asado and Carnitas- the chicken taco was so tender and the dressing was creamy, dressed with carrots. The carnitas was more no frills - meat with a salsa. 

There's a salsa bar on the side and limited seating, one bench table and the rest is counter space along the window.",2
Mariachiâ€™s Restaurant,3,2019-12-23,"Amazing food and drinks. The place is more casual and I loved the decoration. We went at autumn so we could still stay at the patio.

The only thing is that my food was supposed to go in the oven, so my husband dish came first. He finished his meal and then I finally got mine. We complained nicely to the server, but I don't think it made difference. 
I also had a frozen Margherita (which I liked very much) But overall, it's a nice place.",1
Gusto 101,3,2019-08-27,"I ordered a cappuccino with lenticchie while my friend ordered the mushroom bruschetta and panna cotta. I sampled her food as well so I will share my thoughts.

Cappuccino was okay. It was a nice and quick pick me up after work. Lenticchie was average.The lentils were flavoured with crispy salami, pachino tomatoes and zucchini. I couldn't taste the zucchini but the rest was nicely flavoured.

Mushroom bruschetta and panna cotta was Michu better in comparison. Mushroom bruschetta was nice and crunchy. The mushrooms were flavoured nicely and brought out a lot of its natural flavours. The panna cotta has a citrusy taste and a really great summer treat!

Servers were quick to refill waters and to check if we were doing okay. Price point is fairly high for what we ordered but will come back to try the pasta.",1
Hong Kong Bistro Cafe,4,2018-08-13,"I was so worried this restaurant would be packed when I walked in on Saturday afternoon with a party of 8.  Thank god it was only half full.

The restaurant is on a 2nd level and somewhat small but not too crowded.  
The menu is extensive and you can get pretty much everything that's available in Markham.

I got:
1. Grilled chicken with spaghetti in black peppercorn sauce
- This was delicious.  The pasta was soft without being soggy and I think they melted a little of butter into it - yum.  
- The chicken was a good size and cooked perfectly.  
- The sauce complemented the whole dish, I would definitely reorder.
2. The beef skewers were great. But for $8 it was hefty for 4 skewers. We also found a small fly in our fruit salad. The waiter took off my lemonade ice tea to placate us and gave us another small bowl of fruit salad.  
3. Chicken fried rice. I shuddered a little when my boyfriend ordered this but it turned out very well overall.  The rice wasn't soaked in soy sauce and tasted like your usual chow fan with nice big chunks of chicken and eggs.

Overall this is a pretty good place to hit up if you're craving HK style food.

Service is Chinese (ie. not friendly but very efficient).
Tip: Waiter here speaks both Cantonese and English fluently (huge plus for anybody that's afraid of a language barrier).",2
Dumpling House Restaurant,3,2020-05-07,"With lots of businesses closing at 6pm, I'm grateful dumpling house is open late, until 10:30pm on a week night!

Since the lockdown, I've ordered their vegetarian frozen dumpling, filled with greens and diced tofu, their frozen green onion pancake and their takeout braised eggplant and sautÃ©ed green beans.

As a disclaimer, eggplants are probably my favourite things to eat, and i love how buttery it is here at Dumpling House. Just yummy! As for the sautÃ©ed green beans, FYI they are seasoned with lots of minced garlic and a spicy and tangy bean sauce. Proceed with caution if you can't take too much heat! Otherwise, to me its just mildly spicy. 

Love having this in the neighbourhood, a great spot that I'll definitely visit, hope to dine in soon!",1
Donatello Restaurant,3,2017-09-24,"A girlfriend took me here for my birthday celebration. Loved the ambience here, and we were lucky enough to be seated on the upper deck patio. Beautiful space - the deck was covered by a huge tree decorated by fairy lights. This made it feel like we were in a completely differently place altogether, away from the hustle and bustle of Downtown Toronto. 

The room next to the upper deck had a family celebrating a birthday; and there was a lady playing the accordion for them. Almost felt like we were in Italy!

I'm giving this restaurant a 3 stars rating solely because of the food. I had the Zuppa Di Pesce, which I asked the sauce to be replaced with the rosÃ© sauce.  I wasn't very impressed with the pasta considering the price. Both in taste and in the seafood quality. 

Service at this restaurant was great - we casually brought up that it was my birthday and they brought a complimentary tiramisu as a surprise! So wonderful! 

I would certainly come back here for drinks/appetizer considering how amazing the space is!",1

Playa Cabana,3,2018-08-13,"I've been duped by yelp reviews!! We were given recommendations for this place as a great lunch spot which was super cute inside and patio area was so inviting. The stars were for the decor and the one dish! 

Food we ordered:
Chile Rellenos- with rice and black beans- this was the star dish for sure, two large chille rellenos and delicious rice. Sauce was tasty as well. 

Guacamole- prepared guacamole probably mixed with fresh avocado, you can just tell it's from a bag because it's watery instead of creamy. Not special at all

Grilled fish tacos- this is so upsetting, they said it was bass, well it's not. If it was it's the mushiest bass I've ever eaten. Three little tacos that that hid the tiny piece of fish for $19 bucks! Sad don't get this

So disappointed",1
House of Gourmet,1,2019-05-27,"This is my first and last time trying this place, here is why:
1. Service: I get it, lots of people come here for food, lineup is long, and not that many waiters, but when I was trying to order food, the server was literally so impatient that he kept tapping his fingers on the table loudly, I spent like 2 minutes thinking and he made me feel like I was wasting his time. This is a big NONO for me.
2. The rice noodle roll around fried doughç‚¸ä¸¤è‚ ç²‰: for all the people on yelp who recommended it, I really think u should try more places for this before recommendation. I have never seen people put it in soy sauce, ITS SUPPOSED TO BE CRISPY and u put it in liquid, what is the common sense here? And the bottom layer of it was so soggy I didn't even know what I was eatin, mush or food. Then I took a bite of the top layer rolls which did not touch any of the sauce, the fried dough was so soggy and soft and then I suddenly understood why they had to put sauce on it ---- to cover the fact that they don't even know how to make this dish. DO NOT ORDER.
3. Two meat combo rice - roasted pork and roasted duck. When we asked them about the roasted pork, waiter said ""it's crispy"", it WAS 100% NOT CRISPY. I don't understand how do they expect people to pay for dishes with this low quality, I really don't get it.

I can find at least 3 restaurants which costs much less in Chinatown and still beats this place in every aspects, so if I were u, I would avoid it for life.",0

Mi Taco Taqueria,2,2019-06-28,"In retrospect, it might have been a mistake to order a burrito from a taco joint.

But I'm a burrito guy; I would easily say it's one of my favorite foods ever, so if I spot it on a menu, I'm almost certainly ordering it.

And so it was that I found myself placing an order for a Carne Asada Burrito with all the fixins (including guacamole, which I paid extra for) on a recent Thursday evening.

After a wait of about 10 minutes, my burrito was ready to eat and I knew I had made a mistake with the very first bite. That first taste contained only plain iceberg lettuce and, worse still, it was almost ice cold. Yikes.

As I continued eating, I did begin to taste the Carne Asada and other ingredients and they are, to put it mildly, nothing special. There are virtually no bold flavors to be had here, and though I had asked for the spiciest level of heat, the burrito was surprisingly, disappointing bland.

The meat itself was chewy and unspectacular, too. The whole thing just tasted of a complete and total lack of effort, ultimately.

I might return to try one of Mi Taco's, uh, tacos, but I can't see myself ever ordering another burrito - especially when the far, far superior Burrito Boyz is just around the corner. (Heck, the nearby Mucho Burrito makes a better product!)",0
Sichuan Garden Restaurant,3,2017-12-03,"Location: poor atmosphere, looks like the cliche Chinese restaurant right out of a movie. No eye appeal whatsoever. 

Food: ordered the chicken fried rice and the beef with ginger and spring onions. Being used to eating foods flavored with haberno peppers, we had them make our dishes spicy. The rice was very flavorful and nicely spiced. The beef dish was ok, didn't really stand alone well but mixed with the rice It was good. The water cups looked really dingy, which I didn't drink out of it Bc of that reason. 

Overall: food was good, if you don't mind the appearance of the place, I'd say go for it.",1
Ha Gow Dim Sum House,1,2019-03-03,"Went today with my boyfriend to try the dim sum over the weekend and was disappointed. Got there at 1:30 PM and ordered about four or five different dim sum's and was told to wait while it was being made. 

The order was for take out. Waited for an hour and a bit and still no end in sight of when I would get my order. I must've seen five Uber eats pick up their orders way after me and there were two or three people behind the line that got seated for dine in, and got served their food before me getting my order. 

After waiting patiently for an hour for my take out order to be completed I went up to the cashier and told them to cancel our order since it wasn't even made at that point. All they said was that they were really backed up. I spoke to both workers and said this isn't right that you guys didn't tell us we have to wait A whole hour for take out. We have been standing at the restaurant at the lineup for a whole hour and still our order was not made at that point in time. Poor Organization.",0
Levetto,3,2018-11-17,"Came on a Saturday evening at 5:30 and it was empty. I had this place on my list of food to try and was looking forward to checking in and getting a free dessert. 

I was sad when they told me there wasn't any more panna cotta left which is what they would normally give as the free dessert. 

I ordered the Smoked Prosciutto pizza which wasn't bad, I enjoyed the dough as it was crispy but still fluffy inside. Looks like they make everything fresh by hand which is nice. I will try have to try the pasta next time.",1
Hacienda las AmÃ©ricas,1,2019-10-25,"Food was awful - worst tacos I've had in my entire life - the meat tasted funky like it had gone bad and was burnt. The rice was bland with zero seasoning. They never even brought out the app we asked for (but they did try to charge us for it). I have no idea how this place has so many high ratings, the only positive is the food is cheap (although even at this price point it's not worth it). Even the mojito was subpar.

Stay home and make your own - it'll probably taste like a Michelin restaurant in comparison.",0
House of Gourmet,3,2019-09-23,"I came to House of Gourmet looking for a quick lunch break from work. 

It's been quite a while since I had some noodles in soup so I decided upon going to a place I've known since childhood. Upon entering, I was seated immediately and I ordered a bowl of Beef Brisket Rice Noodle Soup. 

The broth was exactly how I remembered from my youth. Layers of flavour, while still retaining its heat. The rice noodles were cooked to a decent al dente, however the beef brisket was a bit disappointing. It was not tender and took quite a while for me to chew. I did wish they cooked down the brisket a lot more as any good beef noodle soup does require soft and tender beef brisket. 

The service is what you would expect at any quick service Chinese restaurant. You go there, order quickly, eat and get out. 

It's a great place for a quick bite from their wide extensive menu, especially if you're looking for a homestyle meal after the bar/club. This place has lot a bit of its mystique from its hey day but it is still one of Chinatown's prime spots for Cantonese food.",1
7 Numbers Restaurant,1,2019-10-25,"Extremely disappointing and mundane. 

Served frozen fish, the lasagna pasta was so overcooked it was actually falling apart and floury. There was not one element of any dishes that I actually enjoyed and while sitting here, I can't wait to leave so I can go to shoppers and get a frozen pizza...",0
Dumpling House Restaurant,3,2020-04-22,"This place has great dumplings (especially their pan fried ones, pork and chive is my fave), but there was one time when I went, maybe almost 2 years ago that really pissed me off. I would be more inclined to give this place 4 stars if it weren't for poor customer treatment. 

It was busy in the restaurant and a line was forming. My friend and I had just finished our meal. I had ordered a soy milk and was finishing it while also trying to buy tickets for a movie on my phone. I was aware that there was a lineup and I was trying to hurry but not chug my drink, but I was still finishing so I didn't think it would be an issue. One of the older ladies who runs the restaurant (in Chinese we would call her the 'lao ban niang') complained loudly and angrily to her staff in Chinese that I was playing on my phone and ordered them to clean our table up in an effort to get us to leave. It doesn't sound too bad when I type it out but it's just different in Chinese and her tone was angry. Only my mom talks to me like that when she's scolding me. I was very annoyed when I heard this, but finished my drink and got up to leave. The same woman put on a fake smile and said ""thank you!"" as we walked out the door. 

In this case, she probably didn't think I would understand her, which is probably also why she said what she said, but it really ruined my meal. Unfortunately for her, I understood every word. I hope they will exercise more caution when talking about customers in Chinese. I am Asian so I am used to less than ideal service at some mom and pop restaurants so I am understanding of most service at Chinese restaurants but I also don't like being scolded behind my back, and then treated so drastically different to my face.

In that moment I dramatically vowed never to return but the dumplings are too good and I have since returned and had pleasant experiences.

I mean, I doubt the woman even remembers that this happened but it was a bad enough experience that I felt compelled to write about it so long after, but the food is still good and I would recommend this place to people who don't mind feeling rushed when they eat. 

I like the potato threads and shanghai noodles in addition to boiled and pan fried dumplings.",1
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria,2,2018-12-11,"I found this place while walking around Yorkville. I came without reservations but I was seated quickly as the restaurant was fairly empty on a weeknight. 

The restaurant is pretty spacious. They have a private dining room on the upper level for large groups. The ambience is upscale and relaxing.

Service:

The server was nice but she wasn't around very often. I had to wave another server down for more water since my assigned server barely checked up on my table.

Food:
Calamari Fritti - The calamari was pretty standard.

Fettucine Alla riviera -  The fettucine pasta was disappointing as the sauce was underwhelming. It was pretty bland. 

Gnocchi Alla Dimmi - The gnocchi was decent.

Overall:

Great location with a nice ambiance. However, poor service and overpriced, mediocre food. They may be busy but that may be because of their convenient location.",0
7 Numbers Restaurant,2,2017-02-05,"I can't believe there are such high ratings for 7 numbers. I had high expectations for this place before coming due to the reviews. But it was about a 2.5 imho.

Shared the following with hubby...

Arugula salad with red pepper and goat cheese $12
- This was the best dish of the evening (sad isn't it? It was just a salad). I liked it as the goat cheese was part of the dressing. The red pepper was delish but wish the portion was bigger. A tad small for $12

Veal Lasagne - Lasagne with fresh-made pasta sheets, fresh ground veal, mozzarella, and housemade sauce $12.75 (large)
- Our friends ordered a small variation of this and honestly perhaps we should have ordered the small as well. It looked around the same size except it was on a slightly larger plate. There was too much pasta and sauce and too little meat. My friend called her small bowl a snack size pasta. Very saucy. That ""homemade"" sauce seems to make a repeat with a lot of dishes... But it wasn't that impressive. Tasted like something from a can. 

Meatballs - Big meatballs stuffed with mozzarella, smothered in sauce $13
- I didn't like this at all and let my hubby eat most of it. There was only a small pinky tip size mozzarella bit in it. Wasn't even served hot. Way too much sauce. I ended up dipping bread with it.

As for service, the server who served us was very polite but the general manager Tom? (glasses with plaid shirt) was super rude. Three people could not attend last minute and he said something like if I had known, I would have removed this table long ago (they attached another small table to one end). I think he could have handled the situation a lot better. Thanks for denting the mood of a friend's birthday. We noticed Tom kept giving our table dirty looks as well. At least the food came pretty quickly and our server always made sure things were ok. 

Not coming back again. No one was full and we got wings afterwards.",0
Trattoria Taverniti,5,2018-12-18,"Really good Italian restaurant: ordered the mushroom and the bolognese pastas, a pizza and a dessert for 3 people with a bottle of wine came up to approx 115

Waiters are Italian
Really good prices for the area",2
Mi Taco Taqueria,3,2019-09-15,"Mi Taco Taqueria is a festive bright takeout/sit down place to grab a couple tacos and a drink. You order at the cashier and they give you a number so that you can seat yourself during the wait. They have a colorful seating area in the back, with interesting lights and banners to envoke a festive charm to the small space.

We ordered the guac and chips, and 6 tacos. The guac is on the small side but tastes fresh with plenty of herbs and bright flavors. Between the 6 tacos that we had, I prefered the carnitas and the sliced beef tacos the most. The flavoring was the most interesting, while the others were okay but at times a little bland. At $5-6 a peice, the tacos are not cheap but it can be expected due to the popular location.",1
Eataly,2,2020-01-14,"We ate at the Le Pizza La Pasta restaurant. 

I would have given this place 4/5 if it weren't for what happened with our billing/menu.

We came in on a Tuesday night. Put our name in and had a walk around for 40-45 minutes. Overall the food was good. We ordered a pasta and a pizza along with the Burutta as an appetizer. The bread came with some really tasty olive oil. The pizza was excellent with generous toppings. I found our pasta good but not great. 

WHAT WENT WRONG: The menu had the Burutta for $8. When the receipt came - I did a quick glance and paid the bill. However the total came up higher than I thought it would be I went back to look at the receipt. The Burutta showed up as $18. I did a double take on a new menu from the front desk to make sure it said $8. My server was elsewhere by now. I went to the front to ask the hostess who at this point basically dismissed me with a chuckle that the menu was ""printed wrong"". I was in a rush so left but I would have definitely taken this up with the manager.

I really think they should have just fixed their menu (even just pencilled it in), or warned me it was a pricing error when I ordered.",0
Hacienda las AmÃ©ricas,2,2019-09-01,"Hacienda las Americas definitely doesn't live up to the scarce 4.5 star rating it possess on Yelp. The only redeeming factor at Hacienda las Americas were its sauces, which were hot, flavourful and added a nice kick to the entrees. But unfortunately the sauces are meant to compliment the entrees, not substitute them, and the entrees leave a lot to be desired.

I went here with my parents and I got the Carne Asada ($18) and them, the Alambre ($18). The Carne Asada is a steak + rice, beans and salad. The steak was extremely thin, tenderized to a point far from its original state, and couldn't have been more than 6oz. It was not a real steak by any meaning of its traditional definition. Worst of all, the steak was barely warm when it came to the table and it had a slightly foul taste to it and was definitely kept in the fridge a day or two too long. There was nothing in the dish that justified its $18 price point - whether that be the ingredients used, the skill put into making the dish or the quantity of the items. 

My parents got the Alambre (fajitas, rice and beans), which was really no better. Fajitas usually come in fresh out of the grill (sometimes a pan), sizzling, smokey and hot. There was none of that. The fajitas were warm, like the steak I ordered, and seemed more like a product of the microwave than a grill.",0
Stelvio,3,2020-02-15,"The decor was nice and the staff were all very friendly and helpful but it was a veeeery long wait for our main course. I had the Tagliatelle special with sausage, mushroom and black truffles and it was ok, I wasn't that impressed. I wouldn't order it again. But others at my table enjoyed their meals.",1
Buca,1,2019-05-22,"We came here (King St location) Tuesday evening to take our guests from Vancouver to a nice dinner. Buca has been my favorite Italian spots in Toronto and has been my top recommendation for good restaurants in the city. We never once had a negative experience at Buca until last night. It was very disappointing to be in such a classy restaurant only to be treated poorly by their servers. We ordered charcuterie and pasta amongst the 5 of us. As we finished our dinner, we had told our server to pack up my bigoli pasta. As I picked up my takeout box, I realized it was not what I ordered. I quickly told the server that this was not mine and to my surprise, she yelled ""f*** off"" and stormed off in the kitchen. We were in shock as to why she responded this way. She returned shortly after, visibly disgruntled, and told me to stay put while the manager comes to talk to me. The manager arrives and simply tells me to wait while they make a new one for me to take home. She was not apologetic at all. Mind you, we had to wait 30 minutes for them to make the pasta again and as soon as I received it, they did not even acknowledge the fact that it shouldn't have taken that long. 

Mistakes happen but under no circumstances should servers be swearing at their customers. We are extremely confused as to what led to such aggresive remarks when we were the ones who had to wait 30 minutes to get our takeout. Definitely not going back after this incident. Servers were rude and ruined our evening.",0
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3,2020-02-21,"It was alright. Went in here for lunch service and ordered the Khao soi.  I knew all the hype surrounding this restaurant. 

To be honest I don't understand why they are awarded with such accolades I stayed in Thailand for a month so I will use that for comparison. 

I find the Khao soi too rich and coconutty. It over takes the subtle nuances of a balanced dish. It just taste like coconut cream soup. I wouldn't make this the quintessential place for Thai food. Support other local businesses.",1
DaiLo,2,2019-04-23,"One of the few restaurants I was most excited for but was left the most disappointed... Based on the reviews and pictures I came here with high expectations, unfortunately my experience was very underwhelming.

My friends and I ordered the crispy octopus tacos, hakka brown wontons, torched tamari glazed beef carpaccio, sichuan braised beef and the whole fried giggie trout. My table all agreed that the tacos were delicious and the best out of everything, and since this was the first dish brought to us we had very high hopes for the rest of our dinner. 

The rest of our food were just mediocre - it wasn't BAD but it wasn't to die for either. It honestly tasted like stuff we can make at home, which some people may not mind but my friends and I were expecting the fusion tastes to be more noticeable and long the lines of tastes we've never tried or experienced. The flavours/tastes didn't compliment each other or stood out to us at all, so we didn't really experience the ""fusion"" in any of the dishes except for the tacos. 

Some of the criticism agreed by my entire table for certain dishes were:

- the braised beef tasted exactly like the beef in pho, which is weird because the seasoning is completely different
- the wontons were a bit too salty 
- the trout was a bit too oily for us
- not enough sauces on the beef carpaccio, so it was too plain

Not only were the tastes not there, the portions were ridiculously small for the price (especially the tacos), aside from the trout. We usually order the same amount of food for 4 girls elsewhere and never finish - we finished all of the food here and were still hungry! Our final bill was $200 on the dot after taxes which is supposed to be AVERAGE I guess... but not worth it at DaiLo because we weren't full/satisfied. I feel like we could've spent the same amount elsewhere and gotten a better experience with food and actually be full afterwards. 

Despite the food not meeting our expectations, service was outstanding and impeccable. Our server was very patient with us and answered all of our questions, and explained each dish that came out beautifully. Our waters were always filled, and dishes were cleared quickly so our table was never too crowded. It was very quick to get his attention too when needed. 

Would I come back? Most likely not. I applaud DaiLo for trying with the the whole fusion scene but it just didn't work for us. The ""fusion"" additions they tried weren't enough to make most of the dishes stand out to us, the dishes tasted far too familiar at home... Sucks because we all really wanted to like this place!",0
7 Numbers Restaurant,3,2019-09-15,This spot is not bad. The room is ok but nothing exceptional nor disappointing. The food is decent but again neither exceptional nor disappointing. Meatballs were excellent but lasagna was served almost mashed in a bowl and just ok. The wine list is mediocre. Service was nice and friendly. P,1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,5,2019-12-08,"WOW!! Completely understand why this restaurant has such amazing reviews. We arrived here around 7:15pm and only waited 15 minutes before being seated. There's a designated area for those waiting for seating so customers aren't standing around the entrance. 

We ordered the spring rolls (vegetarian), Chef Nuit Pad Thai, and Khao Soi. For the dishes, you're able to select the level of spiciness as well. This was my first time trying Khao Soi at any thai restaurant and I was blown away! The broth was creamy and the dishes were all cooked and seasoned to perfection. 

Definitely one of our favorite meals in Toronto.",2
Carisma,3,2019-05-24,"So far Scallop and Foie Gras Appetizer was the best. Ordered appetizer size of of Seafood Pasta dish. The pasta was super al dente, to the point of being tough. The one one mussel I had was gross but the lone shrimp was good, as  was the calamari. 
Hubby's steak was good but my lamb chops left much to be desired. I prefer the taste of Australian or New Zealand lamb and I forgot to ask where it was from.",1
Giulietta,5,2019-12-15,"Wow wow wow.


I came here after a bad experience at another restaurant and this place blew my mind.

Every dish we had was simply amazing.

We had

The octopus - so tender and the pesto was phenomenal.

The beef carpaccio - a religious experience for me. The mushrooms were cured somehow and have changed how I think about em.

The roasted squash - never knew you could make squash taste that amazing.

The papardelle - a bit too al dente for my taste, but you could really see the taste and effort they've put into this dish and I really appreciate that.

The tiramisu - just look at the photo.

A boulevardier - really well done.


The location has a small entrance but you walk in and it's actually quite large. The servers all seemed really happy and relaxed working there.

And final plus - the washrooms had product from malin and gootze which I first tried in a hotel in Istanbul and fell in love. Havent seen it anywhere else and so happy to see it here.

This is officially my fav Italian spot in TO.",2
Mi Taco Taqueria,3,2018-09-06,"Visited Mi Taco Taqueria for a quick snack - guacamole with chips ($4). The nachos did not tasted fresh. I felt like the guacamole and chips ratio is off. It was very disappointing. Perhaps the other items are better. 

Not a big fan. I may be back to give it a second chance to try the tacos.",1
Agio,3,2018-12-12,"A difficult review to write... have had Agio bookmarked for a long time. 

Pitched it for my work lunch and because everyone trusted me Agio was booked. 

There were a few changes in numbers but the day before I did confirm 9 people with a birthday celebration. 

We arrive to a chilly empty restaurant at 12pm hungry and ready to try delicious pasta. 

We sit and ariund 1215pm i order calamari, trio bruschetta and cauliflower fritters to start. Half of us were there and the other half trickled in. The latest person arrive and we order entrees around 1240pm. 

At 115pm is when we first start to get appetizers. The friendly owner was the only one taking care of tables and cooking. 

Our entrees came around 145pm. The difficulty is that not everyone has a 2 hour lunch. The birthday girl ended up having to leave with no entree just apps because she had an appointment at 2pm. 

We finally wrapped up the meal around 215 with creme brulee on the house, the owner made it specifically for us the might before. 

I liked the apps, amuse bouche of squash stuff grilled zucchini. My spicy tomato spaghetti was delicious and pasta was fresh. 

The chef reminded us this several times that his food is made fresh. 

We ended up being the only table the whole time, off the lunch menu the meatballs werent available and half the table didnt love their entrees. Not 4.5 stars love anyways. 

Disappointing because I felt like the chef should have had someone come in to help or tell us the calamari cant be ordered becausr of the work behind it. Turned out chewy which was unfortunate. 

Just wish there was more communication. It was quite embarrassing for me to be responsible for a mediocre hangry people filled lunch :(

I was still defending the restaurant the next week... ill go back to try with a smaller group. 

It does have character I just don't think it was a good mix for a large group that didn't have 2.5 hrs for lunch.",1

Tall skinny Glass half filled with ice maybe a quarter of a can of pop/coke you're getting $2.30 per serving it left such a bad taste in my mouth I felt ripped off really think about it your customers are paying $23 for a plate of pasta and you can't provide them a full can or a decent portion of your fountain drink really really cheap and I've never seen anything like it in all of my travels so for that is why I'm leaving a three star",1
Dumpling House Restaurant,4,2018-11-12,"As a self proclaimed dumpling snob where my mom's dumplings are 15/10, this place can settle for an 8/10. 

I'm honestly surprised by the less than stellar reviews. Sure, I've been skeptical of this place myself when I pass by it as I walk in Chinatown because I don't trust window displays of women making dumplings from scratch, but upon the chance of eating here, I would recommend you go just go here already. 

I ordered the steam dumplings and they tasted made to order! The skin (which I'm most concerned about) was not that thick and the filling was just right. It was a good skin to meat ratio if you know what I'm saying. 

I got the chive with pork which I really liked. Any chive dumplings- sign me up! If I'm craving some homemade dumplings, you bet i'll come here again!!",2
Miku,4,2019-10-20,"Really delish sushi but OMG it's expensive.

I love sushi and I always try to find a great deal (not bang for your buck!).

The place truly is stunning and the service is excellent and the sushi is REALLY good but I wouldn't go back because the prices are very steep.
I guess you are paying for the real estate (situated in a beautiful waterfront location).

You can easily walk down the street and find quality sushi thats a fraction of the price. 

I highly recommend going here with a group of friends as this allows you to try and sample lots of different types of sushi, sashimi and other dishes that might seem interesting on the menu.

I had the 'Miki Signature Selection' which is what they are known for (Aburi Oshi).",2
Hotopia Downtown,1,2019-08-23,Horrible service. I used Yelp waitlist feature and arrived on time. We stood by the door for 20 minutes and nobody bothered to check on us. All the servers were chatting amongst themselves. No single exchange of words at all with their customers.,0
Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant,3,2019-12-29,"Probably 3.5 stars. Overall, this place wasn't bad but I think it's definitely overhyped. It's known for its fresh seafood, namely king crab and lobster. Although you can choose the flavors, the most popular by far is the garlic fried option in which they fry the seafood with tons of garlic and place it on top of a mound of fries. It tasted good, but I feel like by the nature of the dish, it's hard to mess up. 

The staff also seems to be trained to upsell at every opportunity. The waitress persuaded us to order the crab/lobster combo which came with 5 lbs of lobster and 6lbs of king crab. When they came out to show us the live seafood, they claimed that they only had crabs that were 7.5 plus lbs so we would have to pay for the extra weight. 

The meal itself was good but nothing mind blowing. The soup and dessert (which was just macaroons) were very underwhelming. The crab fried rice also tasted kind of plain and didn't have much crab flavor. I did enjoy the garlic fried lobster and steamed crab legs though. 

They automatically add tax and a 10 percent service charge to the bill. They only accept cash and Canadian debit which is crazy considering how pricey the meal is - who carries that much cash around nowadays? You can pay with USD however it will be for an exchange rate slightly lower than market value. 

If you are set on trying this place, it may not hurt to come once. But considering a meal for four was almost 600$ I was expecting something much more memorable.",1
Kingâ€™s Tacos,3,2019-08-16,Had to check this place out after my friends raved about its authenticity. Staff and servers are warm and welcoming. We ordered take out and didn't have to wait too long. I had the chicken tacos which I found to be dry. May have to try the beef ones next time.,1
La Vecchia Ristorante,3,2019-08-15,"La Vecchia is a cute restaurant with great ambiance near Yonge & Eglinton. It is filled with wooden tables and twinkle lights. 

The service is great. We didn't make a reservation for dinner but snagged a spot at the bar. Both the bartender and our server checked in with us frequently. Our water was constantly filled up and we were asked if we desired further drinks throughout the experience. 

While the food was good, it was simply average. We had the penne alla vodka (gluten free) and the capricciosa pizza. Unfortunately, only a handful of the pasta options could be made gluten free, and none of the pizza could be made gluten free. This was fairly limiting. 

There are various delicious Italian restaurants in the area and unfortunately this one simply didn't stack up (both in taste and gluten free options). I would certainly come back for drinks (I had a delicious Aperol spritz) but would likely not come back for the food.",1

El Charro,3,2018-09-30,"We ordered takeout from here over the weekend and the food was okay. I would consider it mediocre but for the low price of $3-4 per taco you can't really complain. 

Pros:
Low price
Gluten free options (corn tortillas)

Cons:
Not as flavourful as other tacos I have had. 

In all honestly I thought the value was really good but the flavour could be improved.

I ordered the beef and cactus/mushroom taco. They didn't blow me away but they were pretty good for the low price point. 

Would I return?
If I was in the area and needed a gluten and lactose free meal... sure!",1
DaiLo,5,2019-01-12,"Delicious experience and the chef's ability to execute on Chinese fusion is totally on point. 

To me, this place told the perfect story of childhood nostalgia and modern French cuisine.

We made reservations via telephone, but you could also do so on OpenTable. 

Service was fantastic and ours really knew is stuff when telling us about the dish being served. 

Wife & I ended up going with the Dailo's Choice  chef's tasting menu ($65 pp) and were not disappointed! We asked if we could have a few must-have items as part of it, and they were happy to accommodate! Amazing!

To me, the most memorable & nostalgic dish was dessert. It was a Pandan and, wait for it, WHITE RABBIT CANDY icecream with tumeric crisps and some sponge cake. Apparently it was the winner of an internal dish challenge amongst the cooks 2 days ago and it totally blew our minds! Amazing for them to do this and so glad they did!

The amuse bouche was some sort of soup with sesame oil, while don't remember what it was exactly, was so flavourful to start the meal!

Other dishes that were very notable and highly recommend are octopus tacos, truffle fried rice with homemade XO sauce (the XO sauce is amazing), fried watermelon (something unique and yummy), smoked duck platter (so many different flavours & textures!), Melt in your mouth pork hock, and their interpretation of turnip cakes.

All in all, delicious experience and really enjoyed the tasting menu.

When we return, we'll probably try Al a carte to try a few more other dishes. But if it's your 1st time, you can't go wrong with the Dailo's Choice.",2
Trattoria Nervosa,4,2020-02-08,"Came here with a craving for something creamy and truffle-based. Lucky for me, I scoped the restaurant ahead of time and was completely entranced by others' photos of their Mafalde ai Funghi ($23). 

Cutting straight to the chase, the pasta was everything I wanted and needed it to be. It was delicious, creamy, earthy.. yum.. it hit just the spot! Portions were fair, especially since cream sauce pastas are so heavy, but I did find myself wanting some more protein in my meal and ended up sharing an order of mussels with my partner.

Although on the more expensive side, I have yet to find myself a better creamy truffle pasta so I guess I'll just have to take the hit whenever I crave this dish! (But if you know of a better place, please do hit me up in my messages!)",2
Taverna Mercatto,3,2019-04-14,"Came for dinner on a Friday night with a girlfriend before a night out. Your typical downtown core restaurant. The vibe is casual because it's near the CN Tower, Skydome & ACC; everyone's in their game gear & it's really loud inside.

Service is fine, nothing really stood out to me - pretty standard job. It took a bit longer than I'd hoped for our food to come out, but it was kind of busy since the jays game was starting/ending. We were also really hungry while waiting, so it might've felt longer.

The food tasted pretty good! I got a seafood linguine, even though I don't normally like to work for my food but the mussels were awesome. I got an okay portion size - slightly lacking in noodles, but my friend got the egg yolk carbonara and it was actually so small, I felt bad. I don't really think it was worth the price of the dish because of the small sizes.

Overall, I probably wouldn't come back. There are better places to get pasta that might be just a bit farther of a walk.",1
Ha Gow Dim Sum House,5,2015-02-23,"The number one dim sum and mom-and-pop shop in Toronto - hands down. The dim sum comes out steamy hot and the dishes are deliciously flavourful! 

We ordered the ha how, siu mai, garlic squid, spinach dumpling, and a bunch of other dishes too. For 2 people, I suggest ordering at least  6 or 7 dishes (each are around $3-4). Our total came to $35 with tax and tip. This restaurant is a definitely among my top 10 places to eat in Toronto. I am in a dim sum nirvana just reminiscing about our dinner here. Only locals know about this place so it's almost never packed.

Pro tip: You need to order at the counter. So pick up an order slip, choose wisely on your fav dishes, and hand it back to the person behind the counter. 

Prop tip 2: You'll need to ""self-serve"". So grab your plates, chopsticks, tea, etc. They only bring you the food. The food makes up for this so I don't care.

Prop tip 3: There's tables that seat up to 4, so don't come with a crowd of 10 or more. 

Transit directions: Take the TTC to Donlands Station, walk towards Danforth (turn right when you exit the station entrance) and then when you're on Danforth, look straight across. It's a bit hidden, but well worth the find.

When we were here, there was a white dude working with the Chinese mom, dad, and uncle. We had speculated that he was adopted but didn't ask. Anyways, they were all super nice. 

Pro tip 4: They deliver locally and have lunch specials.

I wish I lived nearby because I'd be here at least once a week. It's my dim sum secret place, more of an ""super elite spot"" in my books. In comparison, the food here is far superior than compared to any dim sum restaurant near Dundas and Spadina. I think it's their family recipes that are used and the fact that the owners really care about the art of dim sum making. A must eat!",2
Chula Taberna Mexicana,3,2019-10-06,"Friendly service and accommodated a baby no problem on busy Sunday evening.

I tried 3 types of tacos and the standout was the fish taco for me. I absolutely loved my margarita with the star anise spice in it. Must try!
The calamari was pretty weak, very small portions and fried batter falling off.

I would return to try a burrito, they looked massive.",1
Itacate,4,2018-09-06,"If you've got a late night craving (i.e your very drunk), this is the spot. 

The late night torta menu is effectively crack.",2
Mariachiâ€™s Restaurant,2,2018-10-13,"Went there on a Sat night at 6pm for dinner before a movie.  
On the plus side the service was reasonably good.  
On the minus side:
1. The prices were much higher than the menu on their website.  This was misleading.
2. The food was small in both flavour and quantity.  

There are far better Mexican restaurants in the area.",0
La Marquesita,5,2019-02-24,"THIS PLACE IS PHENOMENAL!!!!

Everything from the customer service to the delicious food. I ordered two chicken Puebla tacos  and two carnitas tacos. They were fresh, tasty, and hit all the right flavours. Simple and authentic tacos which heavily focused on good quality meat with minimal filler other than some fresh pico and/or pickled onions (this is how tacos are supposed to be). I came back about 20 minutes later and ordered 4 more tacos because they're were literally THAT good. 

Please check this place out. These guys are legit! The dude wearing the supreme hat was super nice and knowledgeable about the food he was serving. I will definitely be going back very very soon. And I have honestly told everyone about this little place. A solid 10/10. I heard they do catering! Check this place out for sure if you're ever in the downtown area around Ryerson. La Marquesita is a hidden gem!",2
