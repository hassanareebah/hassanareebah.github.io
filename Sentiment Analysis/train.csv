Noodle King,3,2018-02-21,"I love eating here on my comfort food/cheat days.

They have classic Hong Kong style soup noodles and bbq rice dish.  The noodles are made to order.  They have rice noodles, thick noodles, egg noodles to choose from.  Toppings include beef balls, fish balls, bbq pork, shrimp wonton, prom wonton, chicken, lemongrass chicken, beef stew, and others.  Better yet you can pick and choose.  You can get additional toppings like half size wonton, tofu, or beef sauce to add-on.  You can also pick just broccoli or bak choy.

You can pick rice dish too.

There is vegetarian options.

Their soy bean drink is small but tasty.

Staff is nice and friendly.

Line is long but service is fast.",1
Kit Kat Italian Bar & Grill,3,2019-05-29,"I did not choose this place myself, but a friend had reservations for our group of friends on a Saturday night. Waited about 20 minutes to be seated. It is a pretty cozy place and very packed, but I assumed that meant it was delicious too! I thought the food was much too overpriced for the portions. I chose the angel hair pasta and it just tasted like something you whip up at home for a quick meal. I admit I should have just chosen something else with more flavor, but the prices were stopping me. 
I did really enjoy the calamari salad though. It was flavorful and perfectly grilled. Delicious. 
I have to note that it was super chilly inside to the point where my teeth were chattering at the end of our meal. 
I would like to come back to try a different dish though!",1
Sichuan Garden Restaurant,3,2018-11-10,"It looks really sketchy outside but don't like it scare u away, cuz the food is pretty good! Let's talk about the 4 dishes we ordered:

1. Dan dan noodles. Okay I'm pretty sure it is not the authentic dan dan noodles but the way they presented it was pretty smart. All the spicy sauce is on the bottom of the bowl because if u can't take that much spicy then u don't have to stir all into the noodles. But other than that no comments.
2. Chicken dry pot. We ordered this because other three plate wasn't enough. It came on a stove and a pot, it tastes amazing but the fire down the stove is just really concerning I wish they could use some protection around it.
3. Spicy beef. ITS SO GOOD and SO SPICY. I freakin loved it!! I'm not joking about the spicy level of this dish so if u can't really take real spicy u need to bring ice milk with u. Also u need to try the numbing pepper that Sichuan cuisine has, it will numb ur tongue and it is such a cool sensation.
4. Double cooked pork belly. It's extremely salty, like super duper salty. We had to order rice to eat this. 

The service: the waiters and waitresses hang around but they r really slow at services.",1
Levetto,3,2020-05-20,"Freshly made, high quality ingredients. However for me, it was made with too much pepper and it was lacking flavour and creaminess. If an egg yolk was used, I could not taste it. I usually love carbonara, but I would not order this again.",1
Hacienda las Américas,2,2019-01-04,"I really want to write a nicer review for this place because the food is amazing. And $2.50 fish tacos cannot be beat. The sign advertising said fish tacos is what reeled us in. 

But the service was just abysmal. 

My husband and I were eating around Toronto, so we were ordering small plates everywhere we went so we could get the best of all worlds. We ordered their three for $10 tacos (chicken, pork, and beef) and an extra fish taco for $2.50. All the tacos were amazing, the pork being our favourite and the beef, although good, was our least favourite (it was a bit dry). However, the server seemed annoyed that the two of us were ordering so little. We weren't offered side plates to share the tacos, so they were dripping everywhere and we struggled not to make a mess. We were never offered any water and their sauces were very spicy. Thankfully we had our own. And the thing that irked me most was that we were overcharged $1.50 for our tacos. They write the receipts by hand and were originally charged $10 for the three tacos, but they scratched that out and wrote $11.50. Not a huge deal. I asked why we were overcharged and the server said it's because we mixed and matched our tacos. She was kind of rude when I asked. But all the other reviews seem like it's $10 for three tacos regardless of mixing them up. I think they were mad we took up a table and tried to make it up in other ways. I couldn't care less about $1.50, but I don't like shady business practices.",0
House of Gourmet,3,2019-07-22,"(SKIPTHEDISHES Delivery Review)

My friend and I decided to order delivery on a Saturday morning. 
They have a HUGE menu and it was actually a little confusing for indecisive me to find something I could decide on.

We ended up getting:
1. Pork & Preserved Egg Congee: My friend really enjoyed this
2. Minced Beef Congee: The congee came to my apartment HOT (yay) and it was really well made in my opinion. There was a good amount of beef and I liked the amount of ginger in there to give it extra flavor (and it makes me feel 'healthier'
3. Dough Sticks: These were still warm when it arrived. Fairly standard but still a positive that it made it to the apartment without being soggy
4. Rice rolls with Shrimp & Soy Sauce: Never ordering these again. The shrimp didn't seem like it was fresh. The rice rolls were really chewy and plasticky instead of being soft and silky. For $7 the portions were TINY. 

For those 4 very basic things it came to about $27 (not including delivery charge).

I used to come here when I was really little with my grandma as her temple is right next door. I'd come back just to see how it compares in person.",1
Enoteca Sociale,3,2019-05-09,"Enoteca is a nice spot with great drinks and great vibe to grab a bite and hang out with friends. I've driven by Enoteca a number of times and finally had the time to go check this place out. Located just west of Dundas and Dovercourt, you can't miss the massive doors. 

Service was great from start to finish, attentive and overall a good experience. However, the food was decent at best. The Cacio e Pepe was on the saltier side, so be ready for that. It was very rich in flavour, a pinch less of salt and this would be been wonderful. The charcuterie board was decent, although I must say that the cheese was really good. 

Best dish of the night goes to the arancini balls. Really nice and crispy on the outside, stringy and warm cheese on the inside. Drench it in the tomato sauce, you won't regret it.",1
Artisan Plus,3,2019-09-14,"Overall, an OK noodle spot. Interesting to try out but not a must-try. 

I ordered the Famous YoPo Biang Biang Mian (which the waitress mentioned was their most popular dish) and the Shuan Tofu Sheets:

Biang Biang Mian: The plate is quite large so if you're hungry this is the dish to order. The noodles were pretty tasty/chewy and the beef tasted good but the rest of the plate didn't really stand out and was loaded with vegetables (see picture).

Shuan Tofu Sheets: Again, another OK dish but wasn't amazing. While the flavor is there from the peanut and sesame sauce, the texture of the tofu was off-putting after a few strands. We didn't finish the dish. 

If you're looking for spicy noodles, give this restaurant a try. Otherwise, tons more noodle places to eat around Yonge-Dundas.",1
El Nahual Tacos,3,2018-06-12,"Stumbled upon this restaurant while searching for lunch before heading to Yorkdale. The restaurant is quite small, more of a takeout joint and seats about 6 people. The restaurant is very hot and humid and there was only one fan facing the window. There is free street parking (depending on the time), however there is paid parking directly in front of the restaurant.

We ordered the 3 for $12 ( Black Tiger Shrimp, Fish & Carnitas tacos). The food was flavourful, however it didn't hit the spot for me. We also took advantage of the free chips and salsa check in offer.

Overall, nice presentation of the tacos but I wouldn't be going out of my way to come back to satisfy my taco cravings.",1
Artisan Plus,3,2019-09-03,"So much hype we had to stop by and try it out. This place is newish to me located near Dundas and Bay and I've seen it being renovated months ago and thought the interior was really hip and modern looking. This is a noodle place that serves Northern Chinese style, the menu is very simple and don't have too many different things clouding your mind on what to eat. 

We ordered the Artisan Pork Jia Mo, and Shuan Tofu Sheet for starters. The pork Jia Mo is chopped braised pork belly with gravy served in a handcrafted artisan bread, this was not bad but flavour was slightly weak in my opinion. The tofu sheets are made from fresh sheets, this dish is served cold and almost like a salad with shredded peppers, bean sprouts, scallions, chilli, chilli oil, Sichuan pepper corns, and sesame oil. I found that the flavour is good not too much numbing spice and not too spicy but boy it did have tons of oil. 

For mains we ordered their Famous YoPo Biang Mian and the Wok Cumin Che Mian with Spring Lamb. the Biang mian has a lot going on with sauteed tomato, scrambled eggs, cauliflower, potato, carrot, woodear mushrooms, zucchini, edamame beans, paprika, and vinaigrette sitting under all these ingredients are some ribbon noodles which were slightly too long. I thought that this dish was a mixed with way too many things and the flavour got lost way too busy. The Wok Cumin Che Mian with Spring Lamb was better and the lamb wasn't gamy but I wish there was more slices of lamb. This dish I found was a little small for the price. 

Service was great our server was very knowledgeable about their product. She kept our water carafe topped with water. The food comes out very quick and displayed nicely. When it came time to pay the bill was ready and the server came with a debit machine as well. Be prepared to bring cash with you as this place is cash or debit only.

I will be back to try some soup noodles next time. Hopefully it will change my mind and get a better rating.",1
Bang Bang Ice Cream and Bakery,4,2020-01-12,"I can see why bang bang is so popular due to their unique flavours. In the summer sometimes I see lineups around the block! 

I got an ice cream sandwich with Totoro and Lychee Rosewater ice cream. Totoro pretty much tastes like taro milk tea! Lychee rosewater had a tang to it which was refreshing as well. I actually would not recommend and ice cream sandwich though; every time you type to eat it like a normal ice cream sandwich, the ice cream will slide out. So it's best to eat the ice cream and cookies separately. I would go with either ice cream in a cup or in an egg waffle instead (this is a meal in itself though!)",2
Ha Gow Dim Sum House,1,2018-01-14,"Worst Chinese food ever. It's places like this that give Chinese food a bad name. Threw out 75% of our order. 

Ordered what I thought would be staple Cantonese dishes that any decent place would find hard to screw up. Well guess what, Ha Gow managed to do just that. The seafood fried noodles were capital B bland - would it have hurt them to put even one drop of soy sauce? They also used cheap shrimp and squid that had no flavour. We also ordered the fried shrimp with spicy salt. This is honestly the most basic Cantonese dish (equivalent to fries for a Canadian restaurant). Well what came were those cheap shrimps they used for the noodles but smothered in a thick batter (they looked like balls of grease). Each bite oozed with grease and didn't taste like shrimp at all.

The other dishes ordered were equally bad. Seafood dumpling (all it tasted of was MSG), steamed squid in ginger and onion (think rubber bands laced with MSG), and shrimp rolls (no flavour). The spinach & shrimp dumpling was the only thing decent item. 

Avoid, avoid, avoid.",0
El Charro,4,2017-09-19,"Mexican food done right! 

The meat was cooked so well, juicy and flavourful. The caramelized onions added another dimension of great flavour.  We also got guac and chips for $4.50 very good as well. 

To those who complain about waiting for food.. you are only waiting because they are making it fresh. It's not like chipotle where it sits there for what could be hours.

Good prices, good food!",2
Ha Gow Dim Sum House,3,2017-09-30,"Dim sum wasn't bad. I actually preferred this over the downtown China Town dim sum, but markham was better. But if don't feel like a drive thru traffic, not a bad second choice.

Ignore the decor or I think if they rearranged some stuff it would look good. 

Service was attentive but only one server who did everything so be patient. Other reviewers did mention they were out of certain items...which if they were, they should inform us and not have it on the board.

Will go back...",1
Trattoria Taverniti,1,2019-07-12,"Absolutely terrible food and even worse attitude and service. 

Didn't even have a bite of the food",0
House of Gourmet,3,2019-06-26,"Fairly average Chinese food but open late until 2:00 am with lots of seating. They are located a block or so from from Spadina on Dundas.

Their food seems pretty average to me except for their char siu (BBQ Pork) on rice that is my favorite. Everything else is ok but with the exception of great wok hei. If you're looking for a quick bite after a night out this place will do since they open until 2:00 am and has plenty of seating. Their menu is fairly intense about 500 items and with plenty of seating for a big group. 

The food comes out super fast piping hot. Service is ok just need to keep flagging someone down, their table turn over is quick that is the way they operate so don't expect stellar service but they aren't horrible either.",1
Los Guaca-Moles,1,2019-06-01,"II really, really wanted to just love this place and sorry about the loooong review (i am normally not one to have such an extended view) BUT I made two mistakes today:

1) Cancelling my reservation at Playa Cabana ( the last 5:00 pm spot) to go to this restaurant (SMH)
2) The place is supposed to open at 5,like a dumbass I actually waited until 5:20 when they finally decided they felt like opening.

That kind of slackness will get your business shut down in Toronto, with sooooooooooo many good places to go and eat all within blocks who the hell is really gonna stick around and wait for places to open past the time they should be??? ....ohhhhhhhhh the regret folks.   

When I walked in ,there were only two other people seated ( who also decided to sit outside and wait saw them earlier)..hmm wonder if they too had regret, but anyways onto the experience. Walked in and there was a bartender and 1 person sitting at the bar. So we seat ourselves at the front of the restaurant and it literally took the guy behind the bar 10 min. to finally put down some menus, he goes back to the bar chitty chatty with the guy sitting at the bar another 10 min goes by he  comes back to take the order. We order drinks and food (Sabinita-- layers of refried black beans, cheese, sour cream & guacamole, Poblanito -soft tortilla; mole poblano sauce w/shredded chicken breast; garnished w/sesame seeds) and two Pescado- mole poblano sauce w/shredded chicken breast; garnished w/sesame seeds). 

Slowly two of the wait staff make their way in and the guy behind the bar says something in spanish possibly about being late who knows seems to be the trend here, and then another table of patrons come in and than another the wait staff all of two seem confused and dazed. The Sabinita comes to to the table and I ask the waiter if our drinks are coming he says he doesn't know, 5 min later the rest of the order comes out I ask again about the drinks another guy comes over with a menu I said no I ordered them when I first sat down? Repeated the order ( like really the bartender couldn't remember to send out the friggin drinks when at the time there was a total of 4ppl in the place (I could just imagine if there were more than 12 ppl in this place it would be like chaos to remember OMG all these drinks OMG ....seriously its like amateure night in here).

 He comes back minutes later with the drinks, in all fairness not his fault he didn't take the order initially nor was he the  DUH guy that said didn't know when the drinks were coming, and that is the last time we saw anyone come over,no one came by to check on the table to see if everything was good ( which it was NOT) and the place was not busy 4 tables occupied does not constitute as busy.   

 The Poblanito was just ok , the fish tacos were downright dreadful they were breaded in some sort of cornmeal which  was not an issue but the fish they used had a gelatinous texture and honestly there wasn't a dash of seasoning in the coating or the fish itself  not even the toppings were seasoned. IT WAS BLAND  i could barely get through it so so i doused it with hot sauce and still it stank (tastewise) so I only ate the one left the other one on the plate and covered it with my napkin (RIP).

 So now all I have left is half a beer which i'm chugging so I can get the hell outta there!! I indicate to the waiter that we're ready to leave and the bill arrives and he asked how was it ?  I was blunt, honest said it was terrible he was concerned surprised and wanted specifics, so I went off about the fish he said he would go and let the the guy in the back know ,  I said really you don't have to but off he went came back apologised. I said I guess that is just how its done here the only redeeming thing about this whole meal was the Sabinita & the beer.

 Sad to say but  I'm not one to give 2nd chances when it comes to food & service like I said this city is a ""Food Mecca"" too many other places to go and try, so bottom line I would never venture back to this place, I would rather take my $$ and go around the corner to Barrio Coreano or Tacos El Asador where the service and food at least in my experiences have been consistently great .",0
La Carnita,3,2019-07-25,"Came here for the first time by luck, on a Tuesday- had to take advantage of their Taco Tuesday special ($28 for 8 hardshell tacos). 

The service here was friendly but a little slower than normal standards. It is also pretty stuffy inside on a hot day, especially on the top floor, but the restaurant itself is a cute, grungy setup. 

I shared the special with my friend, and it came with the perfect amount of toppings to fill the tacos... it's always so satisfying when you're giving the perfect food ratios. The tacos are presented on a tray along with the (""sides"" is what they call it but I think a better word for it is just the taco stuffings). It came with all your taco essentials, including guac. The ground beef also had a bit of a spicy kick to it, and the taco shells had a different crunch to them. Overall, nothing was mind blowing about the tacos. I think it's fun for when you're coming in a pair with someone else, but you'd need to order more with it to fully fill up an empty stomach (good thing my friend and I had a snack before coming). The tacos were presented nicely but if I were to get this for say, takeout, not sure the deal is worth hyping about. 

I'd be open to coming back to try more of their extravagant tacos though :) judging from their menu the prices seemed reasonable for a downtown restaurant.",1
Trattoria Nervosa,4,2019-12-18,"Their mafalde ai fungi pasta is delicious (although heavy). Their wine selection is pretty good, service is decently quick. It's a great restaurant that brings in a diverse crowd. Although I didn't eat it, their pizza looks good too. Overall, great option to eat Italian in Yorkville!",2
Homemade Ramen,3,2018-10-02,"Pros: quick service, nice staff, great (fresh) ramen noodles 
Cons: dirty table, staff overworked, hard to get a table after lunch still, difficulty finding the best vegetarian/chicken options, some waiters can't communicate in English that well though are super nice and try hard 

Summary: I ordered chicken despite wanting vegetarian but am new to eating more veggie options so I tried to just get the Chicken stir fry. It was all chicken, too much salt and barely any veggies. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again but I'd be open to getting a ramen dish. My mom got beef so I couldn't really try it, I only tried the noodles. She loved her beef ramen so maybe that helps someone out there",1
La Vecchia Ristorante,5,2018-11-18,"I went here years ago for winterlicious because of the great reviews. I was so unimpressed and felt like it was like any other restaurant that I vowed never to come back. Fast forward to recently, my friends wanted to catch dinner before a movie and decided on this place. I was hesitant but went anyways and absolutely loved it! We ordered the pizza, a couple of the salads and some cocktails. LOVED all the cocktails....they were strong and didn't taste it, just the way I like it! The pizza was huge, filling and made very well. Chewy and not overwhelming in flavour. The salads were all fantastic! The Parmesan cheese is to die for. Our waiter was also so charming and funny. He really made our night....p.s. dim lit atmosphere with a picture of the godfather. Loved it!",2
KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL,5,2020-05-04,"My friend got the lunch set which includes a don, salad, some takoyaki and kaarage, sashimi, and miso soup. I believe it was around $18 which is an amazing deal for the amount of variety you get! 

I got the kaarage don, which I have raved about so many times before. Kinka consistently serves fresh food that is full of flavour at an amazing price. It's my favourite izakaya and I will continue to go here again and again!",2
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine,2,2017-12-17,"Last week, I decided to get take out from a nearby restaurant. They said it would take twenty minutes, so I decided to walk around instead of waiting at the restaurant. I had killed some time and by the time I had looped around, I thought hey maybe I can grab one of my favorite treats as dessert. Dynasty was right there, so I went upstairs, proceeded to the counter, looked at their priceless* dim sum menu and ordered one order of the steamed egg yolk custard buns.

I said priceless with an * because I wanted to explain that it didn't have a price next to the items... Not because there menu is super precious. Boy did I ever experience sticker shock. Yes, I do remember Dynasty is over priced and the food is average here. But when I paid over $10 for three tiny buns...I couldn't help but think: didn't I pay just four dollars for three of these, but slightly larger ones, at Rol San a few weeks ago? 

Okay, so maybe the quality is why it's priced higher, I thought. So after eating amazing Indian food for dinner, I dug into the custard buns. The filing is kinda dry... Atop of this, there's some weird film/coating around the ""custard""/yolk. I assume it's edible, because it's in all three, and I ate it. But if I had to compare it against other custard buns that I've had... I'd much prefer a creamy custard instead of something dried up. I don't think of custards as something dried up ever.

There was a time when the buns were good here... Years ago. Its a shame because the other items in the menu here really are average and over priced.",0
Chula Taberna Mexicana,2,2019-07-27,"When did Gerrard and Jones become a popular destination? Good on it. 

Quick summary:

- nice rooftop patio
- I had slowish service
- Food was good. We had a churizo bowl and the ceviche. Both were solid. I didn't notice anything special about the menu. Standard upper-middle level Mexican foods. 
- Drinks ok (cider + tequila based fruity blend).
- overpriced. Why is Mexican food so expensive in Toronto? It's mostly bloody rice, tomatoes, lettuce, avo, standard meats.
- The staff was decent not great but it was busy hence the pressure of Friday night at play. 
- Personally I wouldn't go back at that pricing but if you don't mind that you may like the food. 

2/5 maybe 2.5. 

Tears for Mcguiggan's.",0
La Marquesita,2,2019-11-04,"I ordered a taco from here, the Monterrey Steak. So tiny, it fits in the palm of your hand. Taste was ok but I don't think it is worth $6-7.",0
Comal y Canela,5,2019-05-05,"Three visits to this place so far, and we've gotten the enmoladas (chicken mole enchiladas) each time. The mole sauce is addictive; The blend of spices, chilis, and chocolate is rich, creamy, and balanced. 

If you're looking for the next level of shareable nachos, the asada chilaquiles is a mammoth portion of salsa poured over tortillas and topped with steak, cheese, cream, avocado, and beans on the side. 

They also have a tasty carnitas, a solid birria and pozole, along with various tacos (we liked the gobernador and the cochinita so far). 

Most of the dishes come with three types of salsa, onions, limes, and cilantro to dress your food with.

For drinks, I'd recommend the Jamaica, a hibiscus iced tea, and the Tepache, fermented pineapple juice and piloncillo. They have a lower level of sweetness, which was appreciated.",2
Mariachi’s Restaurant,3,2019-06-06,"So this is my first trip to Canada and I decided to try this place because of a picture I saw of a margarita. So of course,  I did go and order that drink. I asked for a frozen margarita but it was far from frozen. It looked like the machine had melted. They made me another and it looked great but it wasn't sweet. 

I did order the quesadilla with chorizo. It was delicious. They served it Spanish rice and a side salad. First time I've been to a Mexican restaurant and I didn't get black beans. I had the habanero sauce with it and it was super spicy but I live for spicy food!",1
Blooming Orchid,5,2019-05-29,"Run don't walk! 

Blooming Orchid really lives up to the hype. 

I was looking for a new AYCE midtown and found one thanks to Yelp and other reviews!

I will post pics below, the food was fresh, portions were perfect, and the taste was excellent.

The service from Qing nan was flawless, her kind, sweet, and helpful disposition made it an absolute pleasure to dine here during lunch hour. She was working the floor, taking care of all the tables, preparing the deliveries, and taking payment for take-out orders, and still her service was great, jus

They have been open for 7 months now, and they definitely have the right combo, of staff, food, and atmosphere to be around for a long time to come.

The decor was simple, relaxing, and comfortable. The washroom was immaculate and again simply decorated closed off by a frosted swinging glass door to access the area.

Will definitely be back, looking forward to it! 
Did I mention lunch buffet was $15.00 Mon-Thurs",2
Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse,4,2020-03-17,"Came here on a Friday night. Not too busy. 

The exterior of the restaurant looks like a huge storage box. Very rectangular. They have valet parking for $20. I think its pretty pricey since parking in dt toronto drops after 6pm, if you want to save some money, look for parking near the area!

Once you walk in, you will see the reception. It was a bit overwhelming for me, the waitress/serves were standing in a straight line, not talking, and looking at you. Felt a bit uncomfortable. Some people may enjoy this kind of service, i just felt like there were just way too many people standing and looking at you. 

We were seated on the second floor. First floor is the bar area and where the pianist performed. 

Second floor decor was very fancy but minimal, love it. We were seated by the window. The server came by, greeted and went over the menu with us. Do not hesitate to ask them if you have any questions, they are more then welcome to assist you and give you suggestions.

We ordered 2 drinks. Both very strong in alcohol flavors and less juicy or soday. Im not much of a drinker, so that was a bit too strong for me.

The bread came after. Huge, fresh, crispy but soft in the side. Looks like a muffin with a huge mushroom head. Love the bread. WISH there was more. 

The salad came after. The caesar salad is made on the spot in front of you. I love the presentation but flavours wise, it tasted a bit too vinegar and lemony to me. Its not bad, but i had better 3/5. 

The steak and the sides came. 

We ordered the 30 days aged striploin from USA in medium. I felt like the exterior of the steak was a bit burnt, made the steak more on the chewy side. I love how they have 6 different condiments for the steak, recommend the soya sauce and the pink salt. Overall 4/5. 

The mushroom risotto smelt super mushroomy and cheesy. Smell and appearance is 5/5. I just wished it was more creamy, the rice was a bit on the chewy side, maybe a minute or 2 longer in the sauce can make it softer and creamer. Still not bad! 4.5/5!

We ordered 2 sides, and the server recommended we do half side, which we did and super grateful because we were so full after. We had the Sauteed Rapini (the green leaves vegetable) and the potato grantin (potato sliced, and layered in cream and cheese). The rapini have some heat to it, its alright, nothing too too special 3/5. The potato was DELICIOUS, if you love cheese and cream, this is the dish for you! Super cheesy, flavourful, cripsy on the top, soft in the inside. 5/5!

Last but not lease, the dessert was a chocolate pudding, whipped cream with crushed chocolate and oeros on the top and bottom. I love dessert but not a fan of desserts that are too sweet. I thought this would be way too sweet for me, but it was in a perfect balance between sweetness and chewiness. LOVE IT! Just wish there was more. 5/5.

They even give you a small chocolate brownie, a cookie and 2 muffins when you ask for the bill. I was too full to even try the muffin. But overall, the experience was great. I just wish the steak was more tender and juicy and the caesar salad can be less sour or vinegary. Overall 8.5/5",2
King’s Tacos,3,2018-08-26,"I was on the street car when I noticed King's Tacos. I was curious so I went in for a bite. I was expecting a fast food restaurant like Taco Bells, but it was a sit down restaurant. King's Tacos decor was plainly decorated in a casual restaurant style. The service was okay, but you have to pay at the front.

The service started with the waitress bringing little bowls of sauce and onions. I am not familiar with Mexican food or tacos. I ordered the Arrachera taco which is made of beef fillets. I added the ingredients and sauces to the tacos to add flavours. I thought that the tacos were okay.

Would I go back? Maybe to try the other tacos. But I am not familiar with Mexican cuisine so it is hard to evaluate the food.",1
Baretto Caffe,2,2019-09-18,"I was so looking forward to trying this place out based on all the Yelp reviews and I'm sad to say, my experience here was not a good one.  The cafe is so quaint and located inside a non-descript office building with a cute Koi pond to the side.  

There were 3 people working during a busy-ish lunch time and it took them 15+ min to just take our order.  My daughter's cheese pizza came out first with extra sprinkling of Parmesan cheese which she hates.  It would have been nice to know that even a cheese pizza would come showered in Parmesan.  My husband's lasagna took 30 min to arrive with the same amount of Parmesan on top.  You can see the amount of Parmesan on the photos below.  This was perhaps the best dish of the day still.  The lasagna had a nice meaty sauce and was definitely a pre-made lasagna that was reheated which made us wonder why it would take 30 min to just reheat and serve a premade lasagna.  My fettucine primavera also came doused in too much Parmesan in a tomato sauce that was way too watery and sweet.  Let's just say my pasta was beyond disappointing.  

Based on this experience, I am not sure if I would return here any time soon.",0
Lee Chen Asian Bistro,3,2019-04-01,"The interior here is spacious and clean, which makes it a good place for happy hour or business meals. The servers were quick, but it took some effort to get their attention sometimes. 

We had the dan dan noodles, pork belly over rice, XLB, and pan fried dumplings. Although this was a mix of appetizers and dimsum, the amount of food was just enough for us. My favorite was the dan dan noodles, especially with the hot chili oil for those that like spice. 

Overall I had a good dining experience but was a bit disappointed with the dimsum selection. I was looking for a good dimsum restaurant in Chinatown and, for being labeled a dimsum restaurant, there wasn't that much.",1
Sichuan Garden Restaurant,1,2019-05-25,Cockroaches running around.  This place is very dirty and the food isn't nice.  I would not recommend unless you are asking for a stomach ache.,0
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine,2,2019-06-24,"We tried this place since it's close to our hotel and shopping places. 
The ambiance was great and place looks clean. But the service needs a lot of work. The hot and sour soup is terribly spicy and no taste. Just the hot spice. So I ordered another soup. The wonton soup. It took them almost 30 minutes to bring my soup out. And likewise no taste and very UN-CHINESE flavor. 
We also asked one waiter about a cocktail mix and he initially gave me the impression that he does not want to be asked about the drinks and the menu. The waiter said I'll get back it's you but he never did come back. Almost All waiters and servers here are very UNFRIENDLY AND NO SMILE at all. Very disappointing place.!!!!",0

Juicy Dumpling,3,2020-01-10,"It's an interesting concept to see for fast food dumplings. It wasn't bad nor was it really good, but it was perfectly fine for a quick grab and go lunch. 

They all look so delicious, but when it came out, it was clear that it was either made hours before and reheated or just has been sitting out for a while..none of our dumplings were piping hot, and neither was the Soup inside the soup dumplings, which was a bummer. 

The fried chicken was hot and good, but we also ordered the mini sesame balls that tasted a bit like there was some chemical in there and it wasn't fully cooked through-- super gross.",1
Carisma,1,2019-07-04,"Disappointed. 
Good service but not so good food. The pasta was so tough to the point of being uncooked!  the bread was good.",0
Sichuan Garden Restaurant,3,2017-10-01,"I am a bit torn by this rating. I would give it a 2.5 if I could. I was a little freaked out my the fruit flies hovering around my table but I put it aside. Hopefully the kitchen is clean, but what can I do about it, nothing. I order two dishes I get at Trizest, a Sichuan place near my home, in Michigan. The Cold Sichuan noodles were good but a bit bland. The portion size of the small would easily feed two. The Ma Po tofu was again, a large portion. It did seem to lack the Sichuan peppercorns and the mouth numbing effect. I'm a fan of salty but it was way salty. I think it was the preserved black beans that put it over the top. My dish didn't come with rice so I had to order some on the side. All in all it was good, but I wouldn't make a pilgrimage here.",1
Lee Chen Asian Bistro,1,2019-07-19,"Thought this place would live to the rating but it fell flat, and flavorless. We ordered our food and it literally came in 2 minutes. (Yikes!)

Everything was bland and lacking sauce. Service was nice and welcoming, but the food was just subpar and overpriced. I'd save your money.",0
Kit Kat Italian Bar & Grill,3,2019-09-27,"A decent spot for family style Italian food. The food is not very exquisite but doesn't taste too bad either. Pasta was great but other dishes were just okay. 

Beef carpaccio: very salty and oily. Part of the beef tasted frozen. There was also a sharp bitter taste in the bites. It's supposed to be made with truffle oil but I couldn't taste any truffle.  

Veal piccata: very mediocre family style dish 

Smoke duck angelhair: the pasta was very delicious! Perfectly cooked and favoured with lots of toppings. The smoke duck was delicious too.",1
Xola Mexican Food,2,2017-02-24,"Xola Mexican Food would be a great cosy place to take a first date. They promise Mexican food unlike any other. The small setting is endearing. While the service was excellent, and the menu promised good, fresh ingredients...

No salsa or chips to get you started on the house as is usual in the places I've been. Instead, for $10.50 or so, when we ordered the Guacamole as an appetizer, it was excellent and enough for both of us. As good as avocados can be. Not special.

I ordered the Duck. I received a very small serving roast duck taken off the bone in a small bowl, several small wraps, a  1/2 ramekin of chopped fruit for the wrap, a  1/2 ramekin of sour cream. That's it. No potatoes. No rice. No salad. Messy.  It was OK. Not interesting. Cost over $22.00.

My girlfriend ordered braised Lamb. Same thing. It was a tiny portion, stewed and served in a small bowl, with several small wraps,  1/2 ramekin of black beans. That's it. No potatoes. No rice. No salad. It was just OK. The duck was better. Cost over $18.00.

Add 1 beer and 1 excellent Margarita to that, and the bill was $80. 

Because the service was good, a tip had to be added which brought it up to $90.

Moral to this story - Xola is not even close to worth it. You won't find what you're used to or expect to. If you're open to novelty, you'll be disappointed by what you're served and what you're not.

For the best mexican, its worth the trip to Cielito Lindo in Pickering or Mexican Lindo at 971 O'Connor Dr, Toronto  - the very best. And we could have eaten twice for what I paid.

If you want duck or lamb, better to hit Chinatown or Greek Town respectively.",0
Fieramosca,2,2019-01-29,"I have one question: who are you people who gave this a 4 or 5 star rating??????
We visited for dinner on Saturday evening. When the server appeared to fill our water glasses using a plastic pitcher we knew it was a bad sign. Most disappointing dining experience. We made the reservation based on reviews. I'm simply shocked this restaurant has a 4.5 rating. The food attempts to be high end fine cuisine but is really just pretending. We had the caprese salad. The tomatoes were large (rock) hard basic garden tomatoes - served freezing cold. The mozzarella was rubbery, not creamy like a caprese salad should be. The arugula was a basic run-of-the-mill salad. Excessive and boring. I had the black cod special. The portion was huge and that was all it had going for it. The cod was served on a big bowl full of under cooked garden vegetables (carrots and cauliflower) with watery-tomato sauce. It was a dish you'd expect at a family restaurant chain. It wasn't served how black cod should be. My husband's excessive serving of orecchette was bland and served in a bowl of liquid. 

The only positive feedback we can share...the martinis were delicious and the server was lovely and friendly. 

It was a cold evening but the dining room was uncomfortably cold and the washrooms were FREEZING.  Yes, it was a very cold evening in the city but this is a restaurant - it should at least be warm. I understand the restaurant has been around for over 30 years - they've had plenty of time to figure out the heating. 

The dining room is old and tired, not in a charming way. There was paint peeling from the ceiling above us. We were seated at a table beside a shelf loaded with about 100 bottles of wine that hadn't been dusted in the restaurant's 30years. I've not seen a worse display of wine.

I loved that it was a family-owned restaurant - that's whey we went. It's low end and overpriced. This is not a Yorkville-grade restaurant. Save your money.",0
Ristorante Sotto Sotto,2,2018-12-05,"Sotto Sotto has been on my list for a long time and I was happy to be able to dine there recently.

The waiter kept asking us repeatedly if we want sparkling water and we had to tell him at least 3-4 times that we don't. Finally we got our actual drinks and wanted to place the food order. For some reason, the waiter stopped coming to our table. We witnessed other tables order and eat their appetizers and order and get their entrees while we got no service. Finally after being in the restaurant for over 30 minutes (and not placed an order yet) my wife had enough and left the table to find the manager. During this time, the waiter came to our table and said ""I saw you were talking, I didn't want to interrupt you"" which is a rather odd excuse - were we supposed to sit in silence to get serviced?

My wife returned with the manager who was a class act and we got assigned another waiter who was attentive and fantastic for the rest of the night. We decided to share the risotto. I'm not claiming to be expert in Italian food despite being in Italy for over 10 times, but the rice was simply too hard. I'm aware of the fact that you're not supposed to overcook it to a point where it's mushy but too hard is too hard. I was hoping to eat Italian food that's spectacular but it was actually below average and very pricey.",0
MEXITACO,4,2018-12-15,"My go to Mexican eat-in restaurant. Nice and cozy. 

We ordered the following:
1. Carne Asada Platter. 8/10. Plate was a good portion for one person, definitely if you are hungry. Comes with marinated grilled beef topped with a jalepeno, side of grilled onion, beans, guac & 5 corn tortillas. The beef, I wish was cooked a bit more rare. It was a bit tough to cut through. 

2.  TACOS: 
- Baja fish Taco 10/10. The fish was nicely fried in a batter. My fave out of all the tacos tried.
- Tacos de Chorizo 10/10. The spicy chopped sausage was bomb!
- Tacos de Tinga 8/10. Flavour was a bit off for me. The chicken was nicely cooked though.

3. Alcohol - Mangonada - 10/10. Absolutely delicious!!

Service was great. Food was served nice and hot. Will be coming back! :)",2
King’s Tacos,2,2017-10-07,"A disappointment for vegetarians. I'd read about King's tacos on Yelp and on some Facebook discussions and expected to be pleasantly surprised by their home-style serving style and innovative veggie options. Sadly that did not happen. 

We ordered the veggie tacos and were excited to try the welcome chips and salsas. Turns out at least one of the salsas has chicken stock - why!? - and the rest were just watery meh. 

The veggie tacos were fine at best. Pretty oily and just boring. And, finding a meat piece in the veggie mix was the final straw. Definitely won't be back and still in search of a decent veggie taco in Toronto. Tips welcome!",0
Lai Wah Heen,3,2020-05-17,"I give this restaurant three stars. I have been to Lai Wah Heen twice, most recently in January.

Lai Wah Heen is a upscale dim sum restaurant located on the second floor of the DoubleTree by Hilton, in downtown Toronto. The restaurant is spacious and bright, the staff is friendly and the service is excellent.

The dim sum is very good but there aren't many, if any vegetable options so it is quite heavy. Also, it doesn't seem very expensive but the price can increase rather quickly when you purchase a few of the higher priced dishes. The bill was higher when my wife and I went here in January than it was when we took our friend last year for her birthday. We particularly liked the crispy shrimp rolls served with sweet hawthorn sauce and the sticky rice filled with assorted seafood & meat, wrapped & steamed in lotus leaf. The spicy, sweet oyster sauce goes really well with the majority of the dim sum and the tea is excellent.

I will likely return to Lai Wah Heen sometime in the near future. I recommend this restaurant to anyone that likes dim sum and wants experience eating it in a high end setting. Three stars.",1
Khao San Road,3,2019-09-24,"Food 4, 4.5 stars
Not a 5 with the price, average sized portion, about 20 a plate, tad pricey.. place is packed, charge what they want!

ONE STAR for interior; ridiculously loud, annoying.  People hot/sweating, packed everyday, maybe a little AC?
Tight, tight corridors; poor staff, everyone in the way.  Minimal room to maneuver.
Never returning, I'd suggest for those interested; TAKE OUT!",1
Hacienda las Américas,4,2018-02-28,"My top tacos place in Toronto now!  After having some killer authentic tacos in Chicago I've been lamenting my inability to find the same flavor closer to home. Hacienda las Americas has now saved the day!

You know that the food is gonna be good when you are served water in a Tequila bottle and even better that the fish tacos were on special that night! We got baja fish, al pastor, carnitas and beef tacos. Each was absolutely delicious and bursting with flavor. Basically you can do no wrong whatever you choose.

We warned that the place isn't fancy or upscale, more a local tacos joint that the neighborhood seems to hang out at. At one point some water started dripping onto our table from above. We weren't even phased, just switched tables and kept eating (they were that good).",2
King’s Tacos,4,2019-09-26,"This family friendly mexican resturant is great.
We opted for the share option, you get a plate of the meat option you choose and some corn tortillas and make your own tacos. 

Everything tasted great. Service was awesome

Only negative was the dessert. We ordered it to go actually and it was hard as though it's been microwaved to long. Also tasted off definitely not what I'm used to and I've had authentic churros plenty of time.

I'll definitely be back just no churros lol",2
Sichuan Garden Restaurant,3,2018-10-25,"TL;DR Delicious Chinese food but not exactly authentic Sichuan. 

We ordered takeout on a Saturday night - green beans with pork, gong bao chicken, and mapo tofu. 

The green beans with pork was a standout, the beans tasted fresh while nicely fried at the same time, the dish could have used slightly larger pork crumbs though. 

The gongbao chicken was definitely not authentic - it was a bit saucy compared to the normal version and the chicken pieces were larger than normal. It was not spicy at all and maybe a bit sweet. It was still tasty. 

The mapo tofu was also a standout - a bit spicy and very flavourful.
 The portions were large and generous. We can't comment on cleanliness or service since we ordered delivery via DoorDash. 

One star off since neither of us felt like it was authentic Sichuan cuisine - too much cornstarch and a tad too sweet. It was tasty nonetheless. Side note, we both had poor stomaches a few hours after dinner. Can't tell if it was from the meal, just figured we'd add in case.",1
Giulietta,3,2019-04-26,"This restaurant is now on the top 10 list for the best restaurants in Canada.  I came here before the list came out and I have to say I am extremely underwhelmed.  There are much better restaurants in Toronto that deserve to take its place on the list, and especially much better ITALIAN in Toronto.

I had the calamari to start which was fresh and came with some shishito peppers which was fun.  But I find nowadays calamari is pretty good at most places.  For the mains I had the ravioli (cello spinach, stracciatella, walnut pesto) which is not a dish that would bring me back to the restaurant again.  I found the walnut pesto to be overpowering and very gritty/thick, but to be fair I actually don't like walnut that much.  

The pizza I had was thin crust and just nothing amazing.  There is MUCH better pizza elsewhere all over Toronto.  I have NO idea how this restaurant made it to the top restaurant list in Canada and I will not be coming back again.  I am giving 3 stars because the service is FANtastic and the restaurant is beautiful.",1
Dumpling House Restaurant,4,2020-01-27,"Visited on a quiet Monday evening, service was incredibly fast and our server was very friendly. This place does not take credit/debit! Cash only! We ordered the pork and chives pan fried  dumplings and they were pretty good! Nothing special, just your average pan fried dumpling. Fair price - $10 for 12.",2
Baretto Caffe,3,2019-10-30,"The first thing that'll happen when you arrive (after a tiny struggle to find this place cus it's in the corner where the main entrance is) is that you'll be greeted by the nicest lady everrrrr! You can order at the counter for takeout or have a seat by the windows and she'll come over to take you order.

We ordered the alfredo pasta and a pizza. Pizza was a thin flatbread style pizza topped with some cheapo cheese. The alfredo pasta was a good size for the price but really tasted like nothing special. Pasta wasn't homemade and the sauce was pretty average. 

Service over Food here!",1
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine,3,2018-08-28,"I brought my dad, stepmom and half siblings here for dinner as they were visiting from Vietnam and craving some Chinese food and I wanted to take them somewhere classier than the Chinatown restaurants.  BIG MISTAKE.  You can take a girl out of Chinatown, but you CAN'T take the Chinatown out of a girl!!! The service was not good. 

First of all, for the area and price point, I expected to be able to ask the servers about the menu but apparently they don't know why is popular or well-liked. Secondly, my dad and stepmom had a quiet hushed disagreement and the server near us started giving them dirty looks. Everything else was based on lack experience from the servers. Appetizers coming out at the end of the meal, lack of napkins despite having three kids at the table, failure to clear emptied dishes.  

The food was pretty good. While it could not make up for the poor service, I would order takeout from them but I will not dine in again unless there are extenuating circumstances.",1
Good Hombres,5,2019-09-28,"Heard about this spot from a friend, and boy do I love a good taco. Seven lives is just up the street- but I'm committed to giving new spots a fair try. All I can say- Delicious!!! Felt like I was back in Tulum having an authentic Mexican experience. Tacos are so yummy, fast (~3-4mins wait) , fresh (fish was just fried and melted in your moth), cheap ($3.75 per taco)- what more could you ask for ?

Why would I go to a pretentious king st taco resto after this when I know this place exists ?!? We will definitely be back.",2
Ho Ho Barbeque,3,2019-10-26,"This place was ok. We tried the roasted duck, roasted pork, and bbq pork, and pork tongue. Taste was average. Duck was very hard to bite through. Meats were cut sloppily and some barely cut. Floor was sticky. With so many better options around, probably won't try again.",1
Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant,3,2020-01-13,"Stepped into the restaurant and was surrounded by endless tanks of freakishly large crabs. We got the Hong Kong style lobster (4.83 lbs) lunch set that included soup, fried rice, snow pea with goji berries, and dessert. It was nice that we got a bunch of different dishes to try. We also had a lot of food at the end to take home too

Honestly though I started to get sick of the lobster after a few bites since it is fried and quite oily. I ended up eating the veggies/fried rice instead! I also find I prefer lobster fried with ginger and scallion more than HK style. Service was incredibly slow when we went.

Overall I think it was good to try, but I don't know if I would return again. I think it'd be good for special occasions or to treat people that like seafood due to the visual wow factor of the dish though!",1
Harmoney Chinese Restaurant,4,2019-03-25,"I was in Toronto on March 23, 2019 and it was a cold day. Everyone said, this winter has been very cold and doesn't get warm as usual. I was walking around in Chinatown with one purpose only.....eating Xi'an noodles here. Xi'an cuisine is not easy to find where I live, Orange County, CA. If I drive 20 miles or more, there is one. Other than that, I don't see much. Having Xi'an noodles has been my list to do when I came to Toronto. I finally found one here. The rating wasn't that high, but what can I say? I tried Lam noodles....yes, it was what I needed in the cold weather. So hearty, so warm and thick/wide noodles were perfect! The lady in the restaurant didn't speak much English (I thought), but I was able to order since she gives you a paper and pen. Clever!",2
Hong Kong Bistro Cafe,3,2018-01-04,"Hong Kong Bistro Cafe is a HK cafe (cha chaan teng) located in downtown Chinatown. Living in Scarborough, there are tons of HK cafe options in Upper Scarborough and Markham but surprisingly not many downtown that I'm aware of.

HK cafes (cha chaan tengs) serve low cost Canto-Western cuisine and this is a result of Britain's colonization of Hong Kong and as a result it ended up impacting the food served.

I have been to a Hong Kong Bistro Cafe a few times and dropped by recently on a late Friday afternoon during the holiday season. I ordered the lunch special which was a baked grouper in a tomato sauce over a bed of spaghetti, it also came with a soup (choice of Chinese soup, cream soup and Russian Borscht which is essentially a tomato soup) and a HK milk tea for $8.50 plus tax. The spaghetti was pretty basic but the baked grouper was cooked perfectly, really well done. The Russian borscht (tomato soup) soup was basic and the HK milk tea was above average.

Hong Kong Bistro Cafe is a pretty good option downtown if you are looking for a HK cafe and really reasonably priced and service is pretty fast. The food won't blow you away but it's pretty good and the portions are pretty big and fulfilling especially for the price point.",1
King’s Tacos,4,2019-05-21,"Tacos! Love tacos and loved the flavour of the fillings for the tacos here. 

The only thing I wish they did is being able to mix the tacos choices so you could try more of them without going overboard with the meal sizes. Also feel like because of this the prices are a little more than some other taco spots. 

However overall the tacos are great! Had an enjoyable experience. Side note: the churros are massive.",2
Los Guaca-Moles,3,2019-05-11,"Not impressed. I really wanted to like this place. From the reviews it seemed like this was a hidden gem type of place bit all I found there was mediocre overpriced food and indifferent service.
Had the queso fundido which was decent but not great, not hot enough so the cheese was already hardening up, chorizo was bland, also a small portion with only four tortillas for twelve dollars.
The elotes were ok, nothing special. One cob cut in thirds.
The tacos though were really disappointing. Had a fish, a calamari, and a cactus. Three for fifteen dollars was the deal. The fish and calamari were tiny nuggets of tasteless breaded frozen seafood, the nopales tasted like they were straight out of a can. They were all bizarrely garnished with two cucumber half-moons, the fish was garnished with the usual cabbage slaw. 
The two salsas provided were the best part of the meal.
The service was inattentive at best, water was never refilled, waiters were wandering around aimlessly with salsas and dishes, not knowing where they were going. Never were asked how the food was or if we needed anything.
Not a negative experience per se but not one that I care to experience again.",1
Mi Taco Taqueria,3,2018-05-30,"Cool decor, nice location, funky music and great service by everyone I interacted with. 

They have a selection of Mexican beer available as well. What better way to have a taco and a beer in hand? 

I ordered the pork burrito bowl, lots to fill you up. It tasted quite good. But nothing to wow me to come back to try it again. The spice level I ordered was medium. I think it's a bit lighter than you think with the spice level. 

My friend ordered the mix of tacos trying 3 different types. He claims the beef was by far the best one. 

I did enjoy the spread of hot sauces available to use on top of your ordered spice level.",1

If its in the revolving menu that evening, do get the veal sausage.  Its wonderful, juicy, and very tasty.  

Make sure to try the veal meatballs, the eggplant parmigiana, and the almighty Lasagna!

Basically, you cannot go wrong.  And ask for the hot peppers on the side.  I wish they sold these!!!

Food was ok, quite standard and did not wow me. I though will come back or a night cap if I am in the area.",1
Itacate,5,2019-02-22,"My only thought eating Itacate was this is real to the bone. In the back of a butcher shop, the food looked and smelled incredible. There is a huge rotating shanks of meat right above the grill. The menu has no photos and is in straight Spanish so my mum has trouble, but we got a variety of tacos and one super taco(two tortillas fused together with 2 meats). It's not a great place if you're in a rush, but it was very worth the rush. She got steak tacos with grilled cheese put on the oiled tortilla, and the steak melted your mouth. My double taco was probably the best taco I've ever had. The grilled cheese underneath, it had a mix of chorizo and grilled steak. Unbelievable experience, as soon as I have access to car I'm pulling up again. 11/10",2
Good Hombres,5,2019-05-22,"$3.75 tacos! You can't go wrong! This little hidden gem is situated right across from Toronto Western Hospital. You can find street parking for free nearby. The tacos are made fresh and tastes very authentic! The staff are nice and chatty and it's a great place to have nice a quick dinner. I came with my partner and we ordered 5 tacos, quesadilla, and an apple soda for $30. This was the best $30 spent on tacos. If you like tacos, I would rate this higher than seven live tacos in Kensington as it's cleaner, more spacious, service is quick and food is amazing. 

My favourite was the pescado (fish) and carnitas (pork). The fish was cooked perfectly with a crunch and topped with good sauce. The pork was also nicely seasoned and dressed. They offer extra hot oil which isn't spicy (subjective) but the tacos tastes great without it.",2
Harmoney Chinese Restaurant,2,2017-04-26,"This is yet another restaurant in Chinatown which specializes in homemade dumplings and Northern Chinese cuisine. 

I came here only because Yummy Dumplings was closed for lunch on Wednesday, so I ended up here to satisfy my dumpling cravings. 

I ordered the pork & chives dumplings (boiled) which was so so. The skin was thicker than I'm used to but still acceptable & you get 16 dumplings for $7.99. The XLB soup dumplings came next. It was presented in the usual bamboo steamer and you get 10 small bite size pieces. It certainly wasn't my favourite because the skin was thick & some seemed under cooked. The pork filling was okay but the soup content wasn't very consistent. Some were not replete with soup when biting into them and overall wasn't very satisfying. Also it's typically served with some fresh ginger on the side to make your dipping sauce but they don't here. Maybe their Xian style dishes are what they are best known for but it certainly wasn't the dumplings.",0
Terroni,3,2020-02-20,"The only reason I visited was because I had a gift card due to poor service from my previous visit. I'd say they redeemed themselves in terms of service for this visit. Our server was extremely friendly, helpful, and attentive. We were also seated in an area downstairs from the main dining area which made it feel more intimate and allowed the sever to check up on us more often. I came for Valentine's Day dinner and was still able to get a table for a group of 6 a week in advance. 

I ordered the gnocchi and it was alright. The pasta itself was cooked perfectly but the sauce was kind of basic. I've had better gnocchi elsewhere but for the price point here, I was expecting a bit more. I think some pasta may be more worth it than others on their menu. The homemade gelato was the highlight of my meal - super creamy and soft, great flavour, good portion. I had the hazelnut and pistachio and it was some of the best gelato I've ever had. 

Overall, I think you could find better or just as good food elsewhere, at the same price point. But worth a try if your an Italian food lover, even if just for the gelato.",1
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine,3,2019-04-06,"I went for an early dinner and there was one other couple in the restaurant. It slowly picked up with large and noisey families. The good was good. Wontons were a bit greasy but fresh. Dumplings were great. Hate asking for red wine vinegar when I visit dim sum restaurants, as I did here, just leave a bottle on the table next to the soy sauce. Sticky rice was hot but lacked much flavour. No refills on soft drinks. Host was great, server was OK. Nicely decorated room",1
Trattoria Nervosa,3,2020-01-11,"A very popular Italian restaurant, but didn't quite live up to the hype.

We came on a hot summer day and it was very crowded. We ended up getting a seat upstairs outside on the balcony, but it was very crowded--both in terms of people and seating space.
The seats were pretty minuscule and packed together. There was barely enough space for us to squeeze between the tables to sit down on the outer seats--despite being on the thinner side myself. My other friends, who chose to sit on the inner side, would definitely not be able to squeeze into the outer seats because they are tall men who also hit the gym--their extra pound of muscles already cut them from sitting here, so I can only imagine the types of people who are regular patrons. 

We got the calamaratato con gamberi, mafalde al funghi, rigatoni bologanese, and risotto nervosa.
The server recommended the calamaratato con gamberi since it was a popular dish with some spiciness, but it was quite lackluster. The dish wasn't spicy at all, granted we're quite accustomed to spicy foods. 
The mafalde al funghi was delicious and creamy with a full bodied flavour. 
The rigatoni bologanese was a very typical pasta that tasted like a deconstructed lasagna--which isn't a bad thing. It felt too commonplace and lackluster for this price point though.
The risotto nervosa was probably the star of the show. The risotto is amazing and creamy and the braised beef pairs well with it. Though I will admit that the beef, when eaten on its own, felt a little dry. 

Perhaps it's because I'm more accustomed to Asian food, but this restaurant felt quite underwhelming and overpriced.
Many of the dishes didn't stand out too much and is quite comparable to what you would find at much lower price points or even store bought. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but perhaps not worthy of a second visit.",1
Ha Gow Dim Sum House,3,2019-09-22,"Spinich garlic shrimp was great. Beef shu mai was a little salty. Sour and sweet pork was too dry and hard to chew, so they replaced it with sour and sweet chicken.  It is cash only!",1
Grazie Ristorante,3,2019-12-14,"This restaurant was fantastic dealing with some menu modifications that allergies required. Usually there is pushback from the kitchen but not this place. For that we are grateful. 

The modified meal was good, well cooked and an ok all round meal. The pasta in both meals was properly cooked and fresh. The veal however, not as good. It had large sections of charred burnt meat and was quite dry. 

Overall, the service was great, food...mediocre.",1
Buca,3,2019-09-30,"The pasta is really good. You can tell it's homemade once you take a bite. However, prices are quite high with portion sizes small. I ordered the duck pasta and felt I wanted more pasta but I guess it's filling but I don't think it's worth the price. I love my desserts but all their desserts were over $15 so I passed. The service was good and attentive.

They do not do separate cheques. Therefore, if you come with a large group be prepared to grab your calculators so you can split the bill easier. I'm a little annoyed that the host never checked me in with my open table reservation which resulted in a warning email from Open Table for a No Show. He did resolve it after the phone call but it was quite inconvenient to have to call the restaurant to have them fix the problem.",1
Fieramosca,5,2016-11-04,"Heading out to the ROM for FNL with friends, we wanted some hearty, not to mention tasty, food before our evening out. We were all running a little late, but they held our reservation. I arrived first; our table was at the back and ready. Not a large restaurant as it used to be a home. Classic features and comfortable chairs. So far, so good. 

The rest of our party arrived and our fabulous server was there to take our orders. Another server brought over a complimentary slice of bruschetta while we waited. Mmmmmm. He brought our drinks, a fresh bread basket and went over the specials. They sounded so good, I crumbled and ditched my original choice for the Stuffed Gnocchi with Mushrooms and Sundried Tomatoes in a Rose Sauce($22). My friends ordered Spaghetti Mare Di Mario(seafood in spaghetti for $25), Salisiccia E Quaglia Alla Griglia(4 types of meat for $28) and Bomba Pizza(cheese, green peppers, sausage, onions for $18).  

After the bruschetta and trying to abstain from eating a whole loaf of bread, the food arrived. Hot and smelling amazing. After we were all done taking photos of each other's food, the table fell silent as we dug in. After we all tasted our food, we proceeded to share it. SO good. Healthy portions allowed us to share it without any of us feeling guilty. Everyone agreed my Gnocchi was to die for. The pizza was perfect; thin crust and lots of toppings. The 4 meat dish was polished off. All meats were seasoned perfectly. The seafood pasta had a heap of pasta under those clams! 

We were all so full, dessert wasn't even an option. The wine list was delightful. They offered perfect wines to compliment any meal Fieramosca has to offer.  

Service was excellent. Great timing, didn't abandon us, but didn't bug us. Décor was classic and it didn't feel crowded even though it's a smaller space.  

A great start to the evening! Full and ready to continue our night out!",2
Bar Buca,3,2018-08-27,"I reallyyyy wanted to like this place, I was truly excited to try it. 
The ambiance, the decor and the service were all great. But the food was just average for me. 

I really loved the caffè con zabaglione (espresso with sweet italian custard ) It was honestly the highlight of our meal. The Italian Custard gave it a wonderful sweet taste, similarly to how coffee with bailey's would taste. 

Unfortunately they didn't have many Gluten Free options or Vegetarian options, but we managed. 

I ordered the strapazzate dish (pulled mixed farm eggs, burrata & black truffles ) While to some it might seem like a delicate egg dish, to me, it tasted quite bland and lacked flavour. There was essentially no seasoning in the egg. All you tasted was plain egg with burrata cheese. 

I might come back here for a pastry and a coffee, but not for a meal",1
Harmoney Chinese Restaurant,3,2019-02-05,"I am a huge fan of Xian style Biang Biang Mein. I haven't found a place in Toronto that makes this. Therefore, when I found a picture of this dish on their ad outside I had to try it. It is strange that I could not find a yelp review. However, there were plenty of google reviews on this restaurant.

It's own by a couple and I feel they gear their restaurant to Chinese speaking customers. Their English is quite weak. I ordered the Biang Biang noodles and steam dumplings. I wrote the number down and wrote the English name on the paper. The lady had to clarify what I meant with another customer. They make their dumplings from scratch and have a pretty big menu.

I do have to admit their Biang Biang noodles and their dumplings are not the best I had. However, they are cheaper than other places around Spadina. What I did not enjoy was one of the owner/cook was clearing his throat alot during the time I was there which was very gross because you hope he did not spit on your food. Really, clearing your throat should be done in the privacy of your own home and not your business where they are customers.

The owners are nice but they are more friendly to Chinese speaking customers because they can communicate with them. If you cannot speak Chinese they will serve you but you will be ignored most of the time.",1
Miku,5,2020-02-22,"Food: 
Have dined several times at Miku and the restaurant always delivers on a strong note. Dishes are well presented in a simple and elegant manner, and the desired flavour profiles are never hidden. 

Have ordered the nine piece nigiri plate on several occasions. The paired sauces and garnishes are excellent while each piece is masterfully crafted. Personally, I also enjoy the pressed oyshi sushi, which is torched to caramelize the top layer. The sushi is also layered, which provides an optimal fish to rice ratio and creates a nice harmony of gentle acidity from the rice, fused with umami and sweetness from the fish. 

For dessert, the Green Opera ranks among my favourite, if not, my sole favourite dessert in the city. The dessert features layers of génoise, chocolate ganache, sugar twill, hazelnut wafer, and green tea ice cream. The delectable finish always lives up to its name and provides a memorable experience that can cause even the most stringent calorie counter to transgress.

Atmosphere: 
Very spacious for a Japanese restaurant, which ensures a relatively high level of privacy and consequently is frequented by a more corporate crowd. Decor is as expected and layout of the restaurant offers something for everyone.

Service:
On point and as expected for a restaurant at this price level. Servers are descriptive and articulate in the knowledge of their dishes. Always satisfied with the level of service here.",2
Swatow Restaurant,3,2019-08-22,"The food here is amazing. I understand why previous reviews mentioned it being an OG spot and authentic taste overall. They specialized in more FuZhou cooking but it's good cause it doesn't have the oily and greasy taste afterwards. We enjoyed everything we ordered and the portions were a great size for what we needed that day. They cook really good snow pea leaves, probably one of the best I've had in Chinese restaurants. So definitely no complaints about the food at all, it's totally worth it but CASH ONLY! 

The only reason why I'm giving it a 3 is because they don't have the best table service (which seemed to be the case in the Toronto Chinatown area). The waiting staff look really annoyed at you and the lack of hospitality is not what I'm used to when I go to restaurants. Maybe the workers are being overworked and not compensated enough, just don't let it rub you the wrong way if you want to try the food, it does come out fast and I did really enjoy it.",1
Tacos El Asador,2,2020-06-02,"The service was amazing, the guy that greeted us especially was very enthusiastic. But .. when it came from the food. it was definitely 1/5. No flavour , no seasoning no nothing. We ordered 6 Tacos, Guac and chips and cheese Pupusas . To begin with the tacos lets just say we didn't eat them all. The shrimp tasted too.. fishy? not enough toppings on the taco. The beef was blend and so was the chicken. Only good thing about our order was the guac and chips. I normally go to taco Gus at Kensington (highly recommend ) and I regret trying something new.",0
Agio,3,2019-12-05,"The food was enjoyable, the service was friendly, and the price was reasonable.

However, though my party of four were the only ones in the restaurant aside from another couple, it took very long for our food to come out. I can't imagine how long it would take if it was a full house.  Based on other reviews here, this seems like an ongoing problem at Agio.

The decor is also a mismatch to what they're trying to be... a restaurant that serves high end Italian cuisine. It's basically a hole in the wall here, well below average in all aspects (floor, tables, decor, walls, washrooms, etc)",1
La Carnita,1,2019-10-06,"I have been here a few years ago and not sure what changed in that time but the service yesterday (Sat - Oct 5) was pretty terrible. If it were only one thing I wouldn't really bother but every aspect left the three of us shaking our heads. 
- even after putting my name down an waiting for an hour, we never got the call that our table is ready. Upon walking in after an hour the hostess checked the iPad and just lead us to the table. No clarification about why we weren't called.
- the table wasn't really cleaned-up or arranged. We had to pick it up and move so my friend could get in and not hit the people sitting on the adjacent table.
- the server didn't show up got more than 10 minutes
- when he finally came to take our order, he only took drink order (we were ready to order the full meal as we had waited over an hour and then 10 mins more for the server). Then after a few more minutes the server came and took our food order. 
- Food arrived, but no silverware to eat (salad). And then when we were almost done eating, we had to remind the server about our drinks order (smh).
- Finally had to wait to get the bill and then to pay too. Almost wanted to just walk out really. 
Mind you when we got our table, the restaurant wasn't as busy as before.",0
Dumpling House Restaurant,1,2019-08-18,"TERRIBLE AND EXTREMELY RUDE SERVICE! LEFT DISAPPOINTED WITH THE QUALITY OF FOOD. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO GO.

My parents and I came here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. We ordered Singaporean fried rice noodle and the 15 steamed chives, egg, and dry salty fish dumplings for $10.99.

1. Noodles came out first (really small portions) and then they gave us the bill. We were like what??? Where is our second dish? And they were confused. They then realized they forgot our dumplings.

2. Dumplings came and only 14 out of 15 showed up. We let it slide. 

3. Zero eggs and salty fish in the dumplings. ONLY CHIVES 

4. When my parents paid the bill, the waitress got angry at us and asked why we didn't tip ... but we did tip and it was underneath the bills. So we were like ""excuse me??? Did you even look to see?"" She flips it over and sees the tip and then changes her energy completely and starts saying thank you. This woman had the audacity to get angry at customers who she treated so poorly yet actually still tipped. Im actually speechless.

Additionally, if you're asian and you complain about the food they just get pissed right back at you. And they tell you your opinion doesn't matter cause the Caucasian people don't seem to mind. Terrible",0
Buca,5,2020-02-16,"One of my new favorite restaurants! Their menu changes constantly, but there are classics that stick around. I visited on Valentine's Day and was pleasantly surprised by how spacious it was inside as the exterior looked unpromising. The entrance can be difficult to find, as you need to walk down an alley facing King St.

The atmosphere inside was perfect for a date night - gently lit and very romantic. All of their meats are cured in house, and you can see it as you walk through the restaurant. Service was unbeatable - our server was very helpful in providing recommendations (as it was our first visit), and checked on us after each course. Water glasses never went empty, and the table was wiped down frequently.

As for food...

Tonno ($19): albacore tuna, my favourite dish from the evening. I'm a big fan of tuna and this dish was not only visually appealing, it was a delight on the palate. I could probably eat 5 plates of this myself, as it's so light and refreshing. Don't be intimidated by the chilis - it's definitely not a spicy dish.

Nodini ($8): tiny bread knots with garlic and olive oil, they were so crispy I thought they were fried (but they're not!) a must try if you visit, one of their most popular menu items.

Cervello ($10): lamb brains wrapped in prosciutto, it was a little salty for my liking, and lamb brains are definitely an acquired taste (really it's the texture more than the taste), but a really interesting experience if you're feeling adventurous.

Salumi di buca ($32 for 5): we opted for the soppressata and petto d'oca, which came with pickled eggplant preserves on the side. Delectable, and easy to see why it's such a popular item on the menu. You can customize your board, choosing between 2-5 meat options (they also offer a cheese board).

Bigoli ($26): duck egg pasta with duck offal ragu, the serving size is small, but the taste was unbelievable. You can tell from one bite that the pasta was made in-house. Since we tried so many things on the menu the small serving size didn't bother me, but if this is all you plan on ordering, you may leave a little hungry.

Pizze bianca ($30): I can't remember the name of the pizza as it was a special menu item, but it was topped with grilled pears and salumi and was an absolute treat. The pizzas here are a decent size, with an ultra thin crispy crust.

Tiramisu ($15): classic Italian dessert, enjoyable, but it was about 80% cream and only 20% ladyfingers. I'd recommend you share this with someone else as it's quite heavy.

Panna cotta ($15): topped with black cherries, cookie crumble, and balsamic reduction, again a very heavy dessert and I wasn't a fan. The toppings were incredible but the panna cotta itself was very tough (almost like a hard jello), and virtually flavourless.

The prices are steep for the small portion sizes, but it's a treat if you do decide to visit.",2
Famiglia Baldassarre,5,2019-07-01,"ugh i love this place so much but why is it so far and randomly located?!

If this was located in downtown Toronto, you can bet I'll go on a pasta diet for this place. Their pasta is insanely fresh (and you can see the team in the back cranking them out) but that also means it sells out fast.

I came 10 min before opening and there was already a line. By the time the store opened, there was a solid line building up behind me. You order at the cashier and they'll ask you if you're to-go or for here. If you ask for it for here, the nice thing is they won't make your pasta until there is a table ready. You can't sit until your food is ready which is nice in a way because no one can reserve the seat while their party is miles behind in the line. Once you are seated (if you're for here), your food will be ready in another 5-10 min.

A few helpful facts:
- This place is cash only 
- They change their menus pretty consistently 
- You should 1000% buy some extra pasta to bring home even if you're not sure because by the time you finish your pasta and decide you want to bring some home, the line will be insane and maybe sold out by the time you reach the counter
- They have complementary bread which is just as good
- I don't need to recommend any dish here because they'are all A++ so order what your heart wants and I can promise you it's going to be incredible!",2
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine,3,2017-10-14,"We were wandering through Yorkville and looking for something to eat when we spotted Dynasty Chinese Cuisine. Dim sum in the middle of Yorkville? Sure, why not.

We requested a seat on their patio and the waiting began. Our waiter finally showed up with menus a few minutes later but honestly, I was baffled (and a little annoyed) by its vagueness. The dim sum menu is devoid of prices, and since our waiter appeared only sporadically, we had to wait a while before we could even begin choosing our food. (Like, if everything is going to cost $10, we certainly weren't going to stay. And because this is Yorkville, that's absolutely a possibility.)

Anyway, he finally explained the menu and the costs, so we decided to order six items. The food was all fine. There were no really distinctive flavors to be found but everything was prepared relatively well. (We did get a short-rib dish that was basically inedible due to a preponderance of bone and cartilage, however.)

I had to wait a while to start eating, though, because I needed a fork and, surprise surprise, our waiter was nowhere to be found.

With service like this and food that's just barely passable, it's hard to envision returning.",1
Sugo,4,2020-03-18,"Giant portion sizes, affordable, a great environment. Came here on a regular weekday night and it was packed. We waited a solid hour before being seated. It is definitely a small establishment. Parking is also your typical Toronto city street parking. I was fortunate enough to find residential parking, most of them are by permit only though, so read the signs! 

Food-wise, I ordered the spaghetti with Bolognese sauce. The pasta was cooked to al dente and bolognese was sparsely embedded with meat. The tomato sauce was tart with a dash of basil and a bit of parmesan (mixed in). It was definitely homemade sauce. It wasn't 100% to my liking as I prefer a more sweet taste. I can tell why others would be so intrigued by this dish however. I am interested in trying their rose sauce pasta at my next visit. So yes, I will be returning! Hopefully with a smaller queue next time, but most likely not.",2
Blooming Orchid,1,2019-11-01,"NEVER ORDER FROM THIS RESTAURANT! We order from them at least 10 times a week, from our staff to our agents. And today they showed us how POOR their customer service is. We got food poisoning from their food and one of their employees called us disrespectful names. When we walked over to talk to the manager, one of their employees lied and said he was the manager AND the owner - told us he doesn't believe us and that we don't ever have to order from them again because our money doesn't keep their business open. THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! Save your money and order from a place you would feel valued as a loyal customer instead!",0
Mariachi’s Restaurant,5,2020-01-26,"Amazing and friendly service! The food is good value and very filling. I ordered the veggie fajitas. Definitely add the habanero sauce to give it more spice. The guacamole and tortilla chips are made fresh. My friend really enjoyed his East LA dish and my partner loved the Morelia dish.i also had the sangria which barely tastes like alcohol, but hit me after half the drink. 

I also bought the habanero sauce to take home.",2
El Charro,3,2020-02-03,"Came here the other day with my friend and ordered two tacos. The steak taco ($4) and the baja fish taco ($7.50). The steak taco was good, the meat was cooked nicely and tasted exactly like what I expected. Unfortunately the baja fish taco was a but underwhelming, kinda dry and just average tasting. The baja fish taco wasn't really worth the extra price, despite how big the piece of  fish was. The lime slices were also pretty dry but since it's winter now I can understand how it happened. 

In general the tacos here are just average, give this place a try if you're in the area and trying to quickly satisfy your taco craving.",1
Xola Mexican Food,5,2018-10-16,"One of the best Mexican restaurants in Toronto. Small little place and is almost always packed. Everything on the menu is delicious, good portions, but a tad overpriced. What can you expect - leases for restaurants in the Beaches are astronomical. Wife has a shellfish allergy and they were honest to say she wasn't safe to eat there due to the small kitchen and chance on cross-contamination. Fantastic choice of rare tequilas. Cant go wrong with Xola!",2
GB Hand-pulled Noodles,3,2019-04-07,"Cheap and delicious, two of my favourite words, accurately describe GB Hand-Pulled Noodles.

As is typically the case, places like this come with its sacrifices. For starters, there was a line out the door when I strolled in one Saturday for lunch with friends. 

We were eventually seated, though I found the tables quite packed together - they really maximized the space....to the detriment of comfort. 

The food makes up for it - I tried the thick beef noodles and they were some of the best I've had. Plus, you can even see your noodles getting pulled and freshly cooked.

But, before you're even finished your delicious bowl, you'll find waiters beginning to clean your table and dropping you the bill - you'll definitely feel rushed when eating here.",1
Mi Taco Taqueria,1,2019-08-28,"Unfortunate to see such a great and authentic place go down in quality after growth in business. 

I loved Mi Taco when it first opened, it has a real authentic feel to it, amazing flavours of everything. 

I went back today after a couple years out of the neighbourhood and was so excited to go back, I was happy to see how busy they were and they had renovated. 

Unfortunately the quality of taco took a MASSIVE hit. The corn tortilla was mush by the time my food came to me. No seasoning at all. What a disappointing experience and loss in Toronto's Taco scene.",0
Ho Ho Barbeque,2,2019-10-08,I was disappointed with this place for the price they charge their portion is so small I got the duck with rice barely any duck a bunch of cheapscapes the duck was okay honestly the duck at congee Queen was better price and way better taste last time I'm coming here,0
Tacos El Asador,3,2020-02-22,"So I'm from San Diego. It is VERY hard for me to find anything even close in taste and quality.

This place has high ratings on here, so we decide to take a shot.

I regret that decision. I ordered three tacos (beef, pastor, carnitas.) The beef tasted like beef jerky, the pastor was super dry and bland, the carnitas tasted like cat food. 

Also you can't just order a small side of chips. It's $10 nachos or $11 guacamole (does it come with chips? Who knows?!)

Super disappointed. Literally had to get boba tea immediately after to cleanse the pallet.",1
Levetto,3,2018-04-15,"This Levetto location is located at Dovercourt and Sudbury, a few minutes away from the busy street of Queen West. I've tried the other Levetto locations before and decided to come back to this particular location as I was in the mood for pasta. I dropped by for lunch on a Thursday; the eatery was quite empty. The pasta I ordered was filing and service was friendly but the food was just forgettable this particular time. I found the pasta to be underwhelming, under seasoned, and overcooked. Unfortunately did not have a good experience here and will not be returning.",1

Noodle King,3,2018-08-30,"Living in Markham & Scarborough before and now close to Chinatown, I had tasted the best and cheap noodle soup. So trying Noodle King for the first time, I wasn't really impressed.

Yes, their Shrimp Wontons are massively huge and I counted 5 pcs in my soup. So I guess that makes a difference considering they give you crappy servings when you eat in food court places.

But I still paid $8.19 for my soup which to me is still not that cheap. Still the soup didn't blow my mind or something.",1
Itacate,2,2019-10-19,"This is a tough one! As some of you may know I love Tacos! I kept hearing that Itacate was the best place to grab the most authentic tacos in Toronto and obviously I had to give it a try. This little spot is located on St.Claire W and it doubles as a Butcher shop. I walk in and it smells amazing! I love pork tacos and since I can cook all other tacos I decided to get the Carnitas and El pastor. I was so excited and 2 of the saddest looking tacos were brought over. 

Now, looks are not everything so I decided to take a bite. Even though the tacos were super plain I figured if the meat is super flavourful I won't need any sauces. The meats were very chewy, at one point I felt like I was eating leather. Most of the Pork had gooey fat all over it and I just wasn't a fan. I added cilantro, onions and the extra spicy sauce which helped with flavour but the meat was a big issue for me. 

Keep Eating,

Dimmi Bar & Trattoria,3,2019-12-17,"Short and Sweet: 
The food was delicious, but the service was lacking. 

Long Story... Long: 
My friend and I both got the grilled calamari. It was delicious and well made. The calamari was a generous portion that fit the price.

The service, however, ruined my visit a bit. We had multiple different waiters, which was confusing. The one towards the end, who had given us our bill was kind and attentive, but the others were rushed, asked the same questions/clarifications multiple times, and generally felt uncomfortable.

I had asked for a balsamic reduction sauce for my order, if possible. I was told that it was, and the waiter came back with what looked like olive oil and balsamic vinegar together in a small container, which can actually be found on our table. I thought, ""this is not what I meant, but no problem."" I got charged 3 extra dollars for this, which I was both unaware of and unhappy about. Apparently they had added truffle oil, which in my experience is distinct and I can normally tell, but I could not in this instance. This is also where the added price came from.

I would have preferred being warned that there would be an extra charge and that they couldn't do the balsamic reduction sauce in the first place.

Otherwise, I did really like the dish, but the overall experience makes me want to pick another restaurant in the Yorkville area.",1
Wilbur Mexicana,3,2019-07-23,"For what this spot is, it's fine. It's a King Street taco spot serving the King West crowd. Meaning, it's a bit overpriced (my dining companion asked me ""Are you SURE you only want 3 tacos...?"" while I was ordering) and a bit gimmicky for my liking. To be fair, I was coming off of having some fabulous tacos a couple of days ago at a little neighbourhood takeout where they mostly serve Latinx locals, AND I'm generally not a fan of anything fusion.

You grab a table and then line up to order and pay cafeteria-style. Then you go to the salsa bar for a very good variety of salsas and pico de gallo. Servers bring the food when it's ready. 

The food itself was fine, though don't order the grilled avocado if you don't eat dairy. It's literally just a grilled avocado. Even a healthy amount of pico de gallo and salsa couldn't save it. I found the tortillas really dry.

Atmosphere is cool and the people watching is pretty great. It was very busy with the after-work crowd. I don't think I'd return if I was craving tacos, but I would definitely hang out on their expanded sidewalk patio for a drink and some chips and guacamole.",1
Chula Taberna Mexicana,3,2019-08-02,"I came here with a friend and ordered the beef and the fish tacos. The food was pretty good, but the restaurant was quite busy so the food took a long time to arrive. The restaurant was also nicely decorated and the rooftop area was very nice.

Anyways that day finally came and I went for my favourite Margarita pizza. But the excitement fizzled as soon as I saw my food. It looked sad. The crust looked crispy but when I bite into it, it was doughy and almost underdone. There was very little ingredients on the pizza and dough to ingredient ration was seriously off. I'm thinking I probably just went at the wrong time on the wrong day but still.... I've literally been waiting over a year to try this place with rad reviews. Honestly disappointed. I didn't even finish it.",0
Dumpling House Restaurant,3,2019-08-17,"You definitely come here for the dumplings and not the service. In typical Chinese fashion, the customer service here is nearly nonexistent. As we walked in, a waitress barked ""cash only"". Half way through our meal we were asked ""any more?"" and before we had a moment to discuss, we were given the bill. Finally, before we actually finished our food, a waitress started clearing our table. 

However, with that said, their dumplings are definitely their redeeming quality. They are handmade and fresh, from the wrappers to the fillings. They also offer a good variety; they have chicken, beef, pork, lamb, shrimp, and vegetarian dumplings. It is also a fairly cheap eat and it is easy to share. If you are willing to put up with poor customer service for good food, this is a decent option.",1

Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse,4,2019-02-17,"Finally had the opportunity to come here after hearing all the great things about this place. Very upscale and posh vibe. 

Servers were descriptive with the menu and was very at tentative. Made great recommendations.

Oysters tasted fresh. Table side Cesar salad was great. Ribeye was well cooked but still tough and chewy. Wasn't particularly well seasoned which is why the side salt and sauces were provided. Could have lived without the rapini and mushroom. Bone marrow is a must. 

Independently a very great experience but tainted from just coming back from Japan.",2
MEXITACO,2,2019-03-02,"Ordered take out on a Saturday evening; Chicken Wings ($12.99), Burrito De Carne Asada ($12.99), and the Quesadillas De Tinga ($8.99). Staff were not overly friendly, ignoring me upon entry, servicing a walk-in couple before me, and assuming I was a food delivery courier.... The portions were all small, especially the SIX wings, yes only 6, which tasted OK. The burrito was one of the worst I've had in the city, lacking any flavour, and the Quesadillas was average. The sour cream that came with the Quesadillas was also questionable as it tasted, and had the consistency of being watered down. At a $25 price point this meal might have garnered 3 stars.

I will never return.

Aside: I noticed they charge $8.50 for pints which I thought was pricey. For reference The Keg charges the same price their craft beer selection.",0
Taverna Mercatto,3,2019-11-20,"I landed in Toronto on the day it was snowing a lot. It was the beginning of the snow season. After checking into Airbnb, I was looking at nearby places to have a good meal. I tried to visit this place. The ambience is pretty nice and the staff was very friendly and welcoming. I went onto try their spaghetti. I didn't like it much as I felt it wasn't properly cooked plus it didn't have much flavor. I finished my meal with Caramel Coppetta dessert (Cookie Crunch Gelato with Roasted Peanuts) and Tiramisu. Tiramisu was again a let down but I loved the Caramel Coppetta. So, overall I would say the experience was pretty average.",1
Artisan Plus,5,2019-06-23,"Sooooooo. Good. No joke, I visited this restaurant and came back for more only 2 days later.

I am so glad that regional Chinese cuisine is exploding onto Toronto's food scene. Don't get me wrong, dim sum is alright, but biang biang noodles are where it's at.

And they are so damn good here. Thick handmade noodles, enveloped in warm sweet and savoury sauce, and served with a generous variety of toppings -- it's just so comforting. I inhaled everything on my plate in record time. I think the $13.99 price point is fair.

The other standout for me was the Shuan Platter ($12.99). It's an appetizer sampler with enoki mushrooms, tofu sheets, and honeycomb tripe doused in chili sesame sauce. Just thinking about the tripe makes my mouth water -- the soft, chewy tripe was the perfect vessel for soaking up the rich sauce. Umami galore.

Pretty much everything else we've tried so far has been delicious, except perhaps the shredded potato salad ($5.99, not pictured). It was a little too vinegary and not spicy enough for my taste, but still complemented the Jia Mo well.

The ambiance is definitely fast-paced during busy prime hours, so come during off peak periods (before 6 pm, after 8:30 pm) to skip the lineups. Service is quite good and, unlike similar restaurants, the servers speak fluent English.

Can't get enough of this place! Try it and thank me later.",2
Artisan Plus,3,2020-01-10,"What did I just eat? lol
I tried their Famous YoPo Biang Biang Mian. It's a random mix of everything. It has a lot of vegetables (potato, mushrooms, carrots, zucchini, egg & tomato) if you want a healthier option. For me, it's not a lot of meat, a smaller portion and not very filling. The hand pulled noodles were good, the right texture, but again not enough quantity.",1
DaiLo,4,2019-07-28,"Dailo is a unique, great restaurant.  It's typically possible to get a table within an hour of showing up, they have a patio right in collage.  

What I really like is the unique dishes. Everything has lots of thought and work put into it. 

My only negative is that they have too much fried food.  Otherwise the menu and quality is fantastic.",2
Hotopia Downtown,2,2019-11-17,"I recently checked out Hotopia with my friend because we wanted to try their sichuan pickled flavour fish soup.  You can choose different kinds of fish like basa fish.  We ended up with Tilapia.  The pot that came was big enough for 2 to 3 people.  My friend and I didn't manage to finish the pot.  The soup was actually pretty good.  It was more sour than spicy, but I liked the mix of flavours.  The Tilapia unfortunately was overly filled with bones.  I was surprised by this.  The staff didn't caution us about the bones, so we ended up spending the evening spitting them out, which was not my idea of an enjoyable meal.  
Maybe there is an alternative without bones.  I would like to go back and check out other dishes on the menu.  It's a fairly new restaurant, and was pretty packed when we were there.  But service was prompt.",0
Fieramosca,2,2019-07-04,"It is on the $$ side so I expected a great meal. I ordered Spaghetti Carbonara. I can't believe the fatty bacon in this dish. I basically picked out all of the bacon grizzle and ate the spaghetti which, aside from the bacon was good. 

The atmosphere in this establishment is uptight. The tables are too close together, you feel crammed in. It did not make for a very relaxed evening.",0
Bar Buca,4,2019-01-04,"Bar Buca is the perfect place to go if you want brunch that's outside the typical eggs benedict, French toast fiasco.

Small cafe with a coffee bar up front. Beautiful interior. The BEST staff. Our waitress (I forget her name) was amazing and checked on us often without being overbearing. She also made conversation with us as we paid rather than just running off with our card.

We both had one of the stuffed foccacias, stuffed with eggs, some sort of pesto sauce, and prosciutto. Delicious and oh so filling. It was so good that I wish I could get the same sandwich here in the states. Their coffee is also very yummy and strong. Definitely a great place to check out if in the area.",2
La Carnita,1,2018-09-24,"Totally disappointing - everything is definitely on the over-seasoned/extremely salty side. Or totally BURNT! 

The chips we were served were totally burnt and we were told they were the batch of the day and there was nothing they can do about it. (Check pic)

The chips were followed by a totally burnt batch of corn- were not talking grill marks here, crust black corn. We were told that how it's severed (no it's not, we've been here before!). Is there no one to check what comes out of the kitchen??

To add insult to injury chewed on an avocado pit in the guacamole. 

Hosting and service were another issue. Extremely disappointing experience all in all. Fails at all basic hospitality and restaurant standard.",0
El Trompo Taco Bar,3,2019-04-07,"El Trompo has always flown over my head - I've walked by a hundred times but never noticed it. I'm happy I finally did, because the tacos here are amazing! These tacos are more ""street"" than Seven Lives', but there's definitely a time and place for them

While the tacos here are great, I was incredibly disappointed that the chips + pico I ordered to start seemed to be store-bought tortilla chips - they reminded me of Tostitos. The pico was pre-made, and super cold out  of the fridge, another disappointment. Plus, service is spotty.",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,4,2020-02-16,"Hip young Thai restaurant that meets or surpasses  the old school authentic Thai restaurant taste! Cool decor and atmosphere, played good music. Young waiters and waitresses. 

Accommodated us by seating us at the bar! They also had the option of traditional Thai floor seating. 

We were in a rush and opted to sit at the bar. The food was unreal!!!!!!!! 

We had a papaya salad for starters which we were hoping was spicy but literally had no spice factor at all. It was ehh...I have had better.

But the main dishes were top notch.

I ordered the Pad Gra Prow with chicken and I can not stop thinking about it. So delicious. The pad thai was also yummy. But the Pad Gra Prow was my absolute fav.",2
Stelvio,5,2020-02-29,"Went on a Saturday afternoon and was one of two pairs there which made me sort of second guess but that went away after I tried the gnocchi. Doesn't matter if it's a packed house or you're the only guests if the food holds up. And the food more than holds up. My brunch buddy got the tagliatelle with mushrooms and raved the entire time. Wish there was better bread with something to dip (oils, etc) but that's my only complaint. Portions don't look big but they are quite filling. It ain't cheap though. Well worth it though.",2
MEXITACO,3,2019-09-19,"I really had high hopes after Reading the other reviews on yelp. Perhaps my review is a little muddied from the fact that I just returned from Mexico City. Nonetheless I found the food to be tasteful, but I'm afraid most of the food we ordered-  the ceviche and the soup was pre- frozen and de thawed to serve. 

Granted we did come in on Monday evening and it was quite dead so I don't think they had a full kitchen working that night. I think I might return one more time on the weekend or a Friday night to see if the service and the food is anymore fresh.",1
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine,3,2019-09-21,"Dynasty is a decent spot if you're looking for Chinese food in the area. The place is nice inside (given its location in Yorkville), and the food selection is quite typical - similar to those found in other Cantonese restaurants. Nothing out of the ordinary. They offer an evening dim sum menu (a slightly condensed version of the regular dim sum selection). Service is pretty good and food comes out quick.",1

Mariachi’s Restaurant,1,2018-06-14,"We went with my children to this restaurant and the service was good but the food was mediocre and heavily priced for the value. I ordered a cheese melt, and got more sausage than cheese and the cheese was cheddar (this dish is not done with cheddar). For $40 dollars per person without alcoholic beverages, one would expect so much more. It was 7 pm and the place was empty. Very disappointed. We won't go back!",0
DaiLo,4,2019-09-01,"[4.5/5 STARS] TLDR: HUGE FAN! My boyfriend brought me here for our one year anniversary dinner. Fave thing I ate here was the deep fried octopus tacos. The jicama shell was the most interesting take on a taco shell I've ever had. 

We started off with some house cocktails. I one that tasted like gin and he got the one with scotch. They were okay. 

The food on the other hand. Delicious! We couldn't decide which dishes to try, the waitresses and waiters were really helpful they suggested the tasting menu which is $68/person and made up of 5 courses of the Dailo's ""greatest hits"" - popular items on and off the menu. Probably the best decision we made. We made sure they knew my dietary restrictions and we were good to go!

They started us off with two amuse-bouche's which was a like a yam dressed in sake. So good! Next course was the Crispy Octopus Tacos (my fave!!!) and Pomelo Betel Leaf. I love the freshness of the lemon grass and the contrast with textures from the nut crumble. Third course was an carnita empanada with satay sauce (not on their current menu) and this tofu tomato salad that tasted like a play on a dairy-free (no mozzarella) caprese salad. The dough for the empanada was sweeter than i was used to but the sauce was so savoury! It made the dish for me! The tofu in the salad was prepared in a way to almost taste like the texture of cheese. It was very interesting and tasty as well. Fourth course we were served their Ontario Pea Dumplings (with truffles) - so rich so heavy so savoury very yummy - and their Hakka Brown Wontons. The sauce with the almond crumble on the wontons was to die for! The wontons themselves tasted so homey. I loved it. Lastly our fifth course was the lamb and sticky rice dish that came with a slaw (so good!!!) and the beet coconut curry dish. By the time I was done with the huge piece of lamb I didn't even have enough room to really enjoy the beet coconut curry. I liked them both though. They finished us off with a ginger sorbet palette cleanser. It was a lot of food for $68/person. I think if you have an appetite this is a great value for the quality of food you get. 

The only criticism I had was that at the end of the meal everything was starting to taste like betel leaf - that minty peppery taste - they had used it chopped up in most of the dishes they served us. The dishes on it's own with the betel leaf were delicious if we ordered that solely, but as a tasting menu, it was sort of overplayed all together.",2
Ho Ho Barbeque,3,2020-01-27,"The barbecue meat here is really good, juicy and tender. I normally get the lunch boxes here, and it's very hit and miss here.
I made the mistake of coming here 1.5 hours before they closed. They ran out of veggies, but still had plenty of meat left.

If you get the young dude cutting your meat, you're gonna get much less meat in your box. he's pretty stingy. and I've gone here 3 times, and every time he cut my meat, I got either bad cuts, or very little.

I've gotten roasted duck rice before, and he gives you the bones and rib area, with one piece of breast so you have one piece with meat.

Today I got 2 boxes, No veggies were left. I got 6 pieces of bbq pork and 5 pieces of roasted pork. and whole box load of rice. was so disappointed! barely any toppings, and they had plenty of meat left!! not like they were running out.

argh! the only part I can't complain is it's 6.50 a box and comes with either soup or a can of pop.

Pro tip, come early, otherwise don't come. and hope it's not the young dude cutting your meat.",1

Buca Yorkville,3,2019-09-18,"I read a lot of good reviews about Buca and finally decided to give this top 10 restaurants in Canada a try. 

I came here with my girlfriend for dinner. The moment I came in, I felt like my voice was buried in the noisy environment immediately. It was as noisy as a sports bar and not a good place for chatting. My friend and I had to shout really loud at each other. I can't say I enjoyed the ambiance at all.

We ordered the fish salami platter to share, which came with squid ink bread. The bread looked interesting but taste was just average. For the salami, we both liked the octopus. The spicy flavoured pork blood salami was interesting to me too. 

For main, I had the duck pasta and my friend had the lobster pasta. It took us an hour to wait for the main dish though. We saw people sitting next to us got their food first when they came in later. The duck pasta was very chewy and very tasty (though a little bit salty). The duck had a tuna salad texture which was quite interesting. My friend enjoyed the lobster pasta in general but she didn't like the fact that the noodle being too thin and soft (it's personal preference, though I agree with her). The portion of the food was small but good enough to feed two small eaters.

In general, the food quality was good but missed the wow factor.  Service was average and it was a bit pricy for the overall experience. A 3.5 star rounded down. I will not consider coming back any time soon.",1
Mariachi’s Restaurant,3,2017-12-21,"The food was good and the presentation was awesome but I expected it to be more flavourful.

Dumpling House Restaurant,3,2020-01-04,"Food is good, we were craving dumplings and we came to the right place. Got a variety of steamed & pan fried dumplings. Food comes pretty quickly but I wished the place was a bit cleaner. The plastic soup spoon was stained from overuse, the condiments were obviously neve really cleaned well everyday. The worst of it though was when we went to pay the bill the lady demanded we add +$2 for tip. I have never been to a restaurant that has said that to me.",1
Nodo Restaurant,5,2019-01-22,"So much to love about dear Nodo.  The pastas are beautifully simple.  The pizza divine. The service is enthusiastic.  I'm confused by the amuse bouche of the olive oil drenched lupini beans, but no matter.  Here's a little yarn as to why they deserve 5 stars and your business: 

After a number of positive experiences, I dropped by to order a couple of pastas to go.  The bartender, who was not busy, was rude and abrasive.  He punched  in my order like a cashier at 7-11 and split.  As he left, I said ""I'd love a glass of wine while I'm waiting."" Which he basically ignored.

The pasta arrived in a bag by a smiling kitchen runner and I got up to leave.  As I left, the manager asked ""how was everything tonight?"" I told him his bartender was an a-hole and was gobsmacked by how terribly he treated me.  His face fell. What happened next was amazing.  The manager couldn't react fast enough, saying it was entirely his fault as he hires the staff that that kind of poor behavior is unacceptable.  He produced a $50 gift card and asked to have another chance to continue to earn my business.  

My wife and I came 2 nights later and were enchanted once again.  We're loyal customers for life.  

The point I'm trying to make is restaurants have off nights.  The management can screw up.  The chef can drop the ball.  We're all human.  What counts is how management reacts to you IN PERSON gripe.  He was a gentleman and handled us with care.  

Going home and giving a restaurant one star because they forgot your dessert is ridiculous.  Saying it's expensive is ridiculous.  The menu is on the door.  

Yelp can be somewhat uneven and unfair in this regard which is why we returned and gave them another chance and it was well worth it.  

Before you ding a restaurant's Yelp score, talk to the management in person.  If they blow you off, leave them one star.  But in this case of perfectly executed damage control, Nodo gets 5.",2
Nodo Restaurant,5,2018-05-21,"NODO YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN! 

This is my second time at Nodo but at the newer location in Hillcrest. I definitely prefer this restaurant in comparaison to the one in the Junction because THEY HAVE A PATIO! 
It is also a lot more spacious and isn't as cramped as the original location. 

1) Service: (4/5) in terms of staff, everyone was very friendly and made sure we were being serviced and welcomed. However, BE PATIENT with your food because it was about a 1hr wait for our meals. I believe this was because they really do take their time to perfect their dishes and I guarantee you that you'll taste it! 

2) Setting: (4.5/5) As I mentioned earlier, this is the second and newest Nodo location. That being said, it is definitely a lot more spacious and the backyard patio is very trendy and cute. 

3) Food: (5/5) Never disappointed with the food at Nodo. You can't go wrong with Homemade pasta?!? 

- Gnocchi Old School: I love gnocchi, but I love Nodo's Gnocchi more. I've also tried the New School on their menu and I can honestly say they are completely different but just as good. The Old School has slow cooked lamb which came out perfectly and was nice tender! It's complimented with a red sauce, whereas the New School has white sauce and mushrooms.

- Bruschetta Pizza: I was not expecting it to be as large as it was! Definitely worth your buck. It was light and fresh, not soggy, so you know they did it right! Would recommend it for a group of 3+ to share. 

- Parpadelle: I think that's how you spell it... my boyfriend ordered this the first time and couldn't resist not getting it again. It's served with a red sauce and have a nice flavour with the homemade pasta. He loved it so I'm sure you will too!

Really enjoyed our time at Nodo Hillcrest and will be back shortly! Hopefully try something new, if we don't crave the same thing as before... love it here!!!",2
Quetzal,3,2019-08-15,"Quetzal is interesting. There's this big huge space that goes for miles with a glimpse into kitchen. At the front, there's a huge table with natural light, and the bar is impeccably stocked and gorgeous. We sat at the bar, and it was fun conversing with our server who was full of quips and stories. His drinks were equally interesting. 

The food though, for Mexican just wasn't as great as the rest of the restaurant itself. Things were plated prettily (maybe a bit oddly), but nothing popped our taste buds as Mexican flavours should. It was just an okay meal. We left a bit hungry and wanting more.",1
Hotopia Downtown,3,2019-11-12,"I walk by Hotopia most days on my way home from work, and if you've ever passed by, you've probably smelled that strongggg spicy spice from outside. Maybe just walking by has even cleared your sinuses. It's been packed (usually with a line up) most nights when I've passed by which is why I've waited so long to check it out, but a few friends and I finally made our way here for dinner this past Sunday. I put my name on the Yelp waitlist for five people for 6pm, which turned out to be unnecessary as there were several empty tables when we arrived. (The restaurant got busy later around 7pm, and there were a few groups waiting for tables).

We have varying levels of spice tolerance between the five of us, so we ordered three dishes to share: pea sprouts in broth, steamed chicken with chili sauce, and the Sichuan pepper numb basa. The pea sprouts were the only non-spicy dish we ordered, and it was pretty standard as far as Chinese pea sprout dishes go (including the high price point). The steamed chicken wasn't too spicy and quite oily - watch out for the bones! The Sichuan pepper numb basa was the main dish that we ate with rice - it's definitely spicy, but not too numbing (as long as you avoid actually eating the peppercorns themselves, which I definitely did). There were quite a lot of pieces of basa as well as eggplant, and despite sweating and turning red from the spice, we found ourselves finishing everything. 

Service is pretty friendly, and they were fast to fill up our water (which we definitely needed). The bill came to ~$14 per person which was pretty decent for such a filling meal. This isn't my favorite type of Chinese cuisine as I'll admit, I can't really handle the heat. But I'm definitely interested in coming back to try some other dishes!",1
Swatow Restaurant,4,2019-09-29,"A classic Hong Kong style Chinese restaurant that opens til late, late at night in Chinatown. It might be open even when Google Maps says it's closed. And one very great thing about this place is its speed. The food is delivered within a few minutes from ordering most of the time.

I come here when ever I just want some Chinese comfort food or when every where else is closed. Their congee is usually good, not perfect, but its thick and creamy. Their beef brisket and tendons are usually on point, super tender and tasty. Their beef and bitter melon on rice is good with a bowl of rice. The sauce is a bit salty, probably expecting you to eat it with bland rice, but the bitter melon is cook quite well. Bitter melon is not for every one though because it is quite bitter. And the stir-fried pea tips are excellent too; it's a bit oily, but it tastes great with the oil. And the stir-fried rice noodles with beef is also nice; it's also very oily, but it tastes nice. I also love their clams with black bean sauce. There is a generous amount, and the sauce isn't either too starchy or watery. 

Overall, I'd recommend coming here to get some classic Hong Kong style stir fries or beef brisket and tendons with noodles or rice.",2

Agio,2,2019-07-27,"I came on a Monday around 5pm with two other people. We ordered 3 dishes (ravioli, lobster pasta and shrimp with veggies) and spent over 100$. Here is a short pros and cons list: 

Pros: 
- The food is good 
- The chef gave us some bread with butter, vinegar and olive oil on the side. He also gave us some baked zucchini as an appetizer. 
- He seems knowledgeable about Italian cuisine. He said that he cooked in Italy for 7 years. 
- a lot of street parking nearby

Cons: 
- The restaurant smells like cat. The odour was very strong. 
- The bathroom is in the basement with a very very low ceiling. It reminded me of the bathrooms one would expect to see at a campsite, so it's very usable, but lots of bugs. 
- The decor is very outdated. 
- Too expensive. The ravioli dish was composed of 4 big ravioli. The lobster pasta was also a fair portion. The shrimp with veggies was my main issue. It cost over 25$ if I recall correctly. It was 3 shrimp with a handful or two of steamed veggies. For the price we paid, we expected more. After we finished our meal, we were still not fully satisfied. We ended up going somewhere else and eating more. 

In my opinion, the cons greatly outweigh the pros. There are many other cleaner Italian restaurants that serve much more equally delicious food for the same price.",0
Wilbur Mexicana,3,2019-12-08,"Gringo af. Lunch and dinner lines go out the door. Don't come here for your undersalted chips and measly-portioned guac. The meat was kind of too salty and even having three tacos made me want a fourth. I guess it's FINE that there's fish tacos but it's kind of overrated. Where is the cilantro?!?! 

I have had better. It's got an Assembly Chef's Hall vibe. It's loud, jammed full of working professionals. Only come here if everything else is closed.",1
Sugo,3,2019-11-27,"This place was really busy on a weekday afternoon (3pm), if you come after 4, there will be a bit of a wait. Customer service is great here, the staff are very friendly. 
I had the giant meatball which was delicious although the sauce it came in was a bit too salty. The spaghetti was good (cooked al dente) and the portion size is huge. The best part of the meal was the tiramisu - it was creamy, decadent and chocolaty, get the tiramisu if you come to Sugo!",1
Ristorante Sotto Sotto,5,2019-10-25,"Sotto Sotta is a spectacular restaurant. The pasta is particularly delicious; homemade, flavourful, and generously portioned.

I enjoyed my birthday and would recommend celebrating special occasions at Sotto Sotto at any time.",2
Hacienda las Américas,3,2019-08-24,"Unfortunately, Hacienda las Americas didn't live up to the hype. My wife and I went here for dinner and got:
- Guacamole and chips: Guac was surprisingly bland and chips tasted store-bought.
- Sopes: This looked like a thick tortilla with lots of meat and veggies on it. It was 3 for $12, which we thought was a pretty good deal so got 6. The standout was the chorizo (super tasty and great bite). The chicken, beef suadero, beef sirloin, and beef tongue were pretty standard-to-good. The carnitas was too stringy and a little tough for me.

Maybe I'm in the (Yelp) minority and wasn't blown away with this place because I didn't get the tacos... but they were using the same meats for the tacos as the sopes, so I'm doubtful I'd have a different review. Worth a try once, but won't be back.",1
Donatello Restaurant,3,2020-02-09,"My group and I came here to celebrate a birthday. There were issues with the reservation, as they had only called to confirm the day of the event, and we found we weren't being treated appropriately because of it by the hostess/first waiter upstairs that we received. It also may have been because of young age compared to the rest of their customers. If you plan to visit, make reservations and make sure there are no miscommunications before arriving. 

They ended up being able to accommodate us and our new waiter downstairs was very friendly and helpful. Despite the service in the beginning, it was quickly turned around with good service and great food. I ordered the gnocchi and it was delicious and filling. 

This place felt more like a date spot than a spot for large parties, there are a few floors, but it's still small. The food would be 5/5 for me but with the initial service, had to give it a 3.",1
Terroni,1,2020-03-18,"This place is definitely deceiving with all the good reviews. The food is not particularly good and we ordered a great variety of food so we could try a little bit of everything. The service was lacking and the mandatory tip amount is fairly high for big groups which we felt they did not deserve. The free bread they handed out at the beginning was not enough for the amount of people we had. We expected them to give us one per person at least and they did not warn us that we would be charged for it when we asked for more when we realized there was not enough for everyone. When the bills came and we asked about it, the server very rudely said if you just don't want to pay go talk to my manager. A lot of us will never come back to this restaurant.",0
Como En Casa,3,2019-07-07,"Rating: 3/5

Summary: 
We believe this restaurant is worth a visit if in the area. We have frequented this place multiple times and there is a reason we keep coming back. The service is extremely friendly and the atmosphere, though tight, is rather warm and welcoming. However, one must be careful when picking their dish because while some taste wonderfully flavorful, others are somewhat disappointing.

The dishes we tried: 
- burrito w/ verde sauce
- fish tacos
- chicken enchiladas
- chicken mole
- guac/salsa w/ chips
- mains circa $12-15
- appetizers circa $6-8

Food:
One of our favorite dishes is the Burrito with Verde Sauce. It's a big hot burrito packed with many flavors. What makes it special, however, is the verde sauce that complements the burrito very well. The verde sauce is a tangy and spicy sauce that consists of tomatillos, jalapenos, and lime. You probably won't get burritos smothered with a delicious sauce at other places where you'd think of getting a burrito (Chipotle, etc.). We'd also point out that the Guacamole tastes extremely fresh with a great rich and creamy feel. The chunky and spicy salsa is also great. The two dipping sauces pair well with the tortilla chips and is worth considering if looking for an appetizer.

However, we were disappointed with some of the dishes we ordered. For example, the enchiladas and chicken mole did not satisfy at all. As for the enchiladas, the ones we had were filled with extremely dry chicken and the wrap itself was also unappetizing.

On a positive note, the service is remarkable. The owner once even gave us a free refill for our horchata (a most delightful sweet drink consisting of rice, vanilla, and cinnamon). The servers are very kind and patient, thus contributing to a better dining experience.

Conclusion: 
Google reviews rates this as a 4.5/5. We give it a 3/5. It's worth a visit if in the area, but there are only certain dishes worth eating. We recommend the chicken or burrito with verde sauce and the horchata.

Lee Chen Asian Bistro,3,2020-01-23,"Came here for team lunch for CNY. Oh man. This place is packed! When we got to the reception desk, the group in front of us did not have a reservation. They were turned away. Glad we did book the day before. 

Anyhow, Chinese food option in the financial district can be rare. And when my colleagues proposed  this place. I was thinking, let's give this a try. 

We got here and were led to our table. After we sat down, I saw the other tables were filled up in 15 mins. Talk about busy. One good thing is they got a lot of staff roaming around to deliver food. Yet, they were super busy regardless. 

We ordered our food and I went with the business lunch with meatball. The food did come out shortly after. The sauce for the meatball isn't super salty. Which I prefer. It has the right texture for the meatball. Other stuff tasted okay. It ain't bad overall, I wasn't wowed by the food.",1
Nodo Restaurant,4,2018-11-06,"I was in the 'hood and stopped by for a nice lunch.

Service is casual, not overly attentive...which is fine.  Some lupini beans / fresh bread with EVOO arrived before our food.  Both were nice!

Prices were in around $20 for pizza/pastas.  The pizza was polished off, but I ate about half the pasta.  It's a healthy portion!  Between the 2 dishes, the Rigatoni with Veal Bolognese sauce was the clear winner.  Pizza was good too, thin, chewy with a slight crunch!

I'd definitely go back, but may try the St. Clair location first to compare notes.  

Don't forget the wine!  Most of it dry, but the organic one that I had was delish...especially with the red sauce!  Yum, yum.",2
Donatello Restaurant,3,2019-08-17,Food was mediocre at best I'm sad to say. The pastas and salads were very generic and like I can make that myself at home. Bread was warm which was nice and the atmosphere of both the outside downstairs/upstairs patios and the interior was nice.,1
Lai Wah Heen,4,2018-10-24,"If you are looking for more fusion dim sum, this is the right place for you. Really love the foie gras tart, the lobster dumpling is pretty good. Didn't like the turnip cake and caviar dumpling as much. Ordered the deep fry veg bean curd roll that's really good too forgot to attach the picture here. The truffle chicken dumplings were okay.
It's a little pricy compare with other dim sum restaurants. 

I would say the food is 3.5 stars but the price of the parking and service made it to 4 stars. 


The parking is cheap as it is located in downtown.",2
La Carnita,1,2020-02-16,"Worst service ever.  Staff don't care about the guests.  No table check. We had to hunt down a server to get a drink and order food. 

Cool vibe but would not recommend",0
Homemade Ramen,3,2018-09-11,"Noodles are what they do best, and that's what brought me back to this restaurant for the second time. It's a budget friendly spot to grab a bite in Chinatown. I really like the texture of the noodles here,  just a bit of chew, but still soft and lots of fun to eat. Everything else that goes with the noodles however doesn't quite stand out. Don't get me wrong, it's still delicious; an unhealthier version of what my mom would make. Maybe I've been spoiled by my moms cooking :p

The stir fried noodles are drowning in oil, and lots of msg used to add flavor to those cold dishes. It's hard to not like it, but so much regrets after. The portions are big but somehow I managed to clean the plate. As I wipe at my oil covered mouth from slurping the stir fried noodle, slowly realizing what I've done, my first instinct is that I should go on a juice cleanse tomorrow. However, as soon as I stepped out of the shop, I'm back to my normal self, thought of juice cleanse replaced by ""what should I have for dinner?""",1
Enoteca Sociale,3,2017-10-27,"This was in a quieter area. The restaurant was really empty when I came on a weekday. They have a small patio area that is facing a small street. We were seated immediately but no one gave us the menus until 5 minutes later. The service was really slow despite the fact that it was early in the evening without many customers. I noticed they were training some employees that day, so only a few were serving the entire restaurant.

Appetizers: Me and my friends tried a few appetizers and we loved every single one of them.The arancini was great, it was so cheesy and the tomato sauce packed enough flavor. My favorite appetizer is definitely the chicken liver mousse though. The mousse was very flavorful and so smooth. The jelly with the mousse added a nice touch. Next best appetizer is the beef crudo. The aioli served with the beef crudo was amazing, and the beef crudo tasted so fresh overall. I say the chicken liver mousse and the beef crudo are a MUST GET here! 

Mains: The pasta we ordered was SOO SALTY! My group kept waving our server for more water. I hope all their pasta isn't like this, it could be the particular one we got. But the pasta was disappointing. The noodles were cooked nicely, but the sauce was just too salty. We also ordered a side dish of green beans which were alright.

In conclusion, I love the food here. The prices are decent. But I would probably stay away from the pasta that we got this time. Perhaps I will try another pasta next time. The service was slow and my table didn't get much attention from our server. I would have rated it higher if there was better service.",1
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria,3,2019-10-16,"It was alright, servers very friendly 5/5 food 3/5 wouldn't go out of my way to come back. VERY LOUD.",1
El Nahual Tacos,2,2019-09-10,"To be completely honest. I was expecting more.
I came in during my lunch while practically salivating on hearing the reviews. I ordered the 3 TACOS: FISH, BARBACOA? AND CARNITAS. fish taco was so bland and had no taste. The beef was pretty good. CARNITAS was decent. Service left more to be desired as the gentleman never asked if I wanted anything else but just requested I pay. Felt rushed.!",0
Homemade Ramen,3,2019-01-06,"Fresh ramen noodles are not the healthiest food you can eat, but do taste so good.  I picked a dish with braised beef.  The noodles were extremely enjoyable. The braised beef was not tender.  Next time I will pick another meat with extra noodles!

Service was prompt & efficient. Decor is very basic.",1
Hotopia Downtown,3,2020-02-23,"Dining here on a Saturday night was a 30 mins wait on the waitlist for a group of four. There was a small waiting area so it wasn't terrible but heads up, the place is pretty noisy

We ordered the ""boiled clams"", the ""Sichuan Picked Flavoured Beef in soup"", and their iced plum green tea

The clams were def a hit and a very reasonable price ($8) we really enjoyed the flavour and quality of the dish

The beef soup sadly was a ""miss"", the beef shavings were decent quality but the taste wasn't enjoyable. Too many peppercorns were left in the dish and slightly tasted off ( I'm unsure if stale or...) 

Tbh the spice level is manageable and not over the top, I just found the flavour to be subpar for Sichuan soup dishes 

The plum green tea isn't a fave either, extremely sweet and diluted (tastes like a watered down freezie )",1
House of Gourmet,3,2019-09-25,"If you're out late night and want to grab some Asian food, then this restaurant is the perfect spot as it closes at 4am. We came around 9:30pm and the restaurant was pretty packed. You can't expect over the top service compared to other restaurants, but for a typical chinese restaurant standards, this restaurant is on average with it. 

We ordered their bbq pork/roasted pork and the black pepper sauce rice with beef. 
- Bbq Pork/ Roasted Pork: As expected, since it was pretty late at night, the meat wasn't fresh. The roasted pork was cold and the skin wasn't as crunchy vs being fresh. The bbq pork was pretty dry and was not juicy at all.
- Black Pepper Sauce rice with beef: This dish was actually really good which is why the ratings not as low. Since it was cooked fresh, the beef was tender and juicy, and the sauce tasted great. Portion size was pretty decent but for the price you pay, you only really get 3-4 pieces of beef. 

I'll probably skip this place next time if I wanted late night food and try out some other restaurants which were pretty busy as well.",1
Trattoria Nervosa,2,2019-11-11,"Unfortunately they did not let us make reservations probably because of the small size of the restaurant. 

I had a really uncomfortable time at this restaurant... let me tell you why...

The seating arrangement of the tables was very poor. 

We were seated on the second floor at a small table. There was another table, located one foot away from us, between us and the wall/window. Directly behind my friends seat was another table, so when she sat down, her chair was almost touching this other table. Directly behind my chair was someone else's chair. We were squished!!

When I sat down my chair was back to back with their chair. There was no room for the people in the table at the window to get out and for the servers to get over to them, so my friend and I had to stand up and tuck our chair in to let them through. When another couple came and sat there, I also had to stand up again and push my chair in to let them through. This was incredibly uncomfortable. 

A restaurant is supposed to be a relaxing place, especially when you are spending hard working money. I shouldn't be standing up and needing to let people through time and time again.

When serving the table behind me, the server had to squeeze behind my chair and stand right against the back and the side of my chair. It was not a relaxing dining experience at all! Service was okay at best, when they weren't getting me to stand up or squish us.

I ordered the malfalde ai fungi, it tasted delicious for the first few bites but the cream was so rich it was difficult to finish and I felt a little nauseous at the end. 

I expected much better!",0
Bang Bang Ice Cream and Bakery,5,2020-02-15,"Bang Bang is likely the ice cream spot that you hear always recommended if you are looking for a good scoop of ice cream in Toronto. You might ask yourself is it really worth the hype and to wait the lineups? Yes. Yes it freaking is.

The flavors here are not your run-of-the-mill ice cream shop flavors. Most are unique in taste and name. You can get your ice cream in a cone, cup, freshly-made waffle cup, as an ice cream sandwich and more! The shop is very, very small. It acts more like a take-out place than an ice cream parlour. 

I honestly would recommend you go maybe 15-30 minutes before it opens and line up. That way you get their freshest scoops and treats without having to wait an hour or more.",2
Sugo,4,2019-10-20,"So I kept reading the veal sandwich was the 'real' deal and not being Italian, I thought m, ""what does that mean?"" I've had plenty of veal sandwiches so how was this one different?
So the veal is thicker and reminded of a steak sandwich. Plus there was more than 1 layer of it! Bonus not skimpy on the meat. Third, the breading was barely noticeable. So you're not eating a ton of batter.
It's $13 for veal, sauce and cheese with 50 cents for every extra. I got mushrooms and peppers.
Very filling. Now I know.",2
Stelvio,3,2018-12-31,"I really have mixed feelings about this restaurant. I dined here for dinner and tried quite good amount of food from appetizer to pastas. I feel like this place is better for lunch as portions are small and the vibe and lighting in the restaurant was too light for me for an evening dinner. I loved the black and white simple decor, however I would definitely recommend having less light towards evening. 

As for the drink, I tried the Pinot Grigio, and I loved it. If you like an easy white wine with notes of sweetness, this would be perfect.

For appetizer, we ordered a cheese and cold cut board. I was not impressed with the selection of cheeses there. There were two types of cheese and two types of cold cuts. Both cheeses tasted very bland and simple. The portion was fairly good though and it came with a honey and house-made jam which was a nice garnish to it. We also got the meatball to share by the server's recommendation. Probably this was my least favorite item. It was different from a usual Italian meatball you imagine, maybe it is the Milanese way. However I did not like it and it was too dry and meaty. We asked for a side tomato sauce so we can dip them in it.

For main, we ordered two different pasta dishes, the Tagliatelle al funghi porcini and Casoncelli alla bergamasca. They make the pastas fresh in house which I think is what makes this restaurant special. The funghi pasta tasted really good and I loved the mushrooms in it, however I felt it was lacking sauce. Casoncelli alla bergamasca was a meat ravioli with some butter sauce on it, however there was just a little butter sauce on it and it tasted very basic to me. I would say both pastas had very small amount of sauce and both tasted very simple.",1
Campechano Taquería,3,2018-06-04,"Great tacos with a good spice level! The food at Campechano is tapas style and they have a wide range of tacos. 

The guacamole is served with a side of spiced nachos - they were a little dry and stale, but the guacamole was fresh. The ceviche is an European bass, with a nice kick of spice as well. I ordered the fish taco which was freshly deep fried and simply delicious. 

The restaurant has a patio with outdoor seating, as well as bench like seating for larger groups. Unfortunately, the service is not as great as the food thus meriting a 3 star.",1
Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse,5,2019-07-21,"Birthday dinner for 10
Superb wine service with Riedel somm stems to accompany the top shelf wine we brought.

From their signature bread & the seafood tower to the risotto & steaks -including Aussie wagyu - everything was  perfect. We also ordered bone marrow and the must have Caesar salad. One of the tenderloins ordered was done medium, no problem, they replaced it and the medium steak was packed up in a doggy bag.

The seating area for 10 was also nice in a sequestered space with windows on both sides at a roundtable on the main floor. 

A dining companion commented on dark chocolate pairing well with a bottle and it was taken care of.

Stayed there well past closing time and we were not feeling rushed in anyway. 

I think this place is better suited for larger groups of 6-8 at least and no bigger than 10. There's a rectangular private dining area downstairs but you end up chatting with folks next to you given the size of the table.

Overall it came to around 450$ with tip and corkage (approx 2 bottles) per person, but was well worth it for a special occasion.",2
Taverna Mercatto,2,2018-12-22,"Came here for a team lunch and ordered the fixed menu because the main menu apparently wasn't fully available during lunch.....very confusing menu setup but ended up ordering the risotto and cheese fried balls and the roasted chicken.

The risotto cheese balls were surprisingly good because when the dish arrived it was very underwhelming. The balls had a really good crust and when i fried poked into one it had a really good cheese pull. What i also enjoyed was the tomato sauce at the bottom which cut the oiliness of the fried balls significantly, a really good match.

The chicken however was very disappointing. The chicken was very tender on the inside but that was probably because small chunks were undercooked and raw ish....the pasta under was kind of dry and clumped together. Lastly the texture was a little boring, there was a little bit of char on the skin but seems to be only from the salamander so the really wasn't a real crust on the chicken.

Overall the restaurant seemed good but just didnt get a good experience this time.",0
La Marquesita,3,2019-05-18,"Food (3/5): decent. The corn chips were nice and crispy but the toppings were lacklustre in taste. There also wasn't enough sauce and cheese to cover the chips 

Price (2.5/5): a bit over priced for what you get 

Ambiance (3.5/5): quaint and cute decor, in a good location. No seating though!

Service (4/5): got this to go through ritual, the food was made fresh and there was only a very brief wait!",1
Kit Kat Italian Bar & Grill,1,2019-08-19,I can't tell you anything about the food as we left after 15 minutes and the waitress not even close to coming to our table.  9:00 at night not the time for the waitress to be telling jokes.,0
Lai Wah Heen,3,2019-07-09,"Dinner:
Peking Duck, 2 courses
Spicy Shrimp hot pot with vermicelli
Shrimp with black bean sauce

I had not been to Lai Wah Heen in several years, until recently.

The two course peking duck was definitely better than in a normal restaurant. I could tell that the flour wraps were of much higher quality than normal. Perhaps made fresh at the restaurant? 
They serve it with the duck, cucumber, green onion already on the wrap, then you can add the sauce on your own.
The second course was a pretty standard version of the lettuce wraps.

Spicy Shrimp Hot Pot with Vermicelli was excellent. I would order this dish again without question. The clear vermicelli noodles are a great compliment to the spicy sauce and large shrimp.

Shrimp with black bean sauce was good, but did not stick out as much.

Overall, it was a good meal, but the prices are prohibitive.",1
Homemade Ramen,2,2019-09-28,This was just okay for me. There are so many hand pulled noodle places in Toronto now that I'm not sure this really stands out. They have generous noodle portions but not so many veggies. Meat was all right. I think my big mistake was getting the chicken wings which turned out being tasteless and with breading similar but (not as flavorful) as KFC. Oh well. On to the next place.,0

Taverna Mercatto,3,2019-08-13,"I'm still so full writing this review; which is usually a good sign!

The service was good all night, including the full glass of water my boyfriend knocked right off the table that was immediately cleaned up, so that aside:

We started with a bottle of wine, Priorat, which was delicious! About ($100), a great Spanish red, highly recommend.

First came out the calamari ($14) delicious but quite a small portion, more for one person than it was shareable.

I got the Carbonara (basic and $18), it wasn't at all spectacular, in fact it wasn't even memorable. And the portion was not that large either.
My boyfriend got the 8oz ($38) and the cook was perfect, while the star of the dish was the layered potato serving oh my 

Followed up with an Amaretto, and a tiramisu for me (creamy, flavourful, large, filling, delicious!!!) and a caramel something for my boyfriend (also creamy and delicious!)

Highly recommend dessert over everything else we had! It's a cozy place to go after work, but not that impressive really. I'd call a 3.5/5 an accurate rating! 

Pictures attached!!

Will I be back? Unlikely, maybe just for that tiramisu some time",1
Harmoney Chinese Restaurant,2,2017-08-06,Really disappointed. We ordered two dishes and wait like an hour for the fish. Maybe it is because we did not order the right thing. But generally i would not go there again.,0
Bang Bang Ice Cream and Bakery,3,2020-01-22,"Sort of an overhyped ice cream shop.

They indeed offer unique flavours, but it's significantly more expensive than necessary. Their flavours are fun to try if you haven't been here, but I would probably never return with their exuberant prices. Two tiny scoops of ice cream can run you nearly $10. You can find plenty of ice cream shops with unique flavours for way less.
Their ice cream is also super melty as well. As soon as I got it, it was already melting all over the place. If you're into soft serve, this is your spot--but I'm a hard serve ice cream kind of person.",1
Trattoria Taverniti,1,2019-09-09,"I was craving pizza for supper this evening.  I was walking along College Street and came across Trattoria Taverniti.  It looked interesting and I'd never been there so I thought I'd check it out.

When I got here around 6:30pm, it was fairly empty but filled up pretty quickly.

I ordered the Carne pizza.  It was a good pizza and I ended up taking some home for lunch tomorrow.  The crust was crispy and I guess it was the sausage that had a bit of a bite.

I paid my bill and was finishing up my wine, getting ready to go.  Then one of the servers asked if I would move to the patio to a high top chair because they needed my table.  I said I wasn't going to be much longer and didn't want to move to a high top (I have a wonky knee).  About ten seconds later, the second server came over and asked me to move and I told her the same thing.  About five minutes later, one of the servers said I really had to leave because they really needed my table.  I just had a sip of wine left and again said I'd be leaving shortly (and did).  I felt a bit uncomfortable because the table next to mine was looking over and wondering what was going on.

So what started out being a pleasant meal got ruined.  I understand that a small restaurant needs to turn the tables over to make money.  But if the table was reserved and I needed to be gone by 7:30pm (so in about an hour), they should have said so when I was seated so the expectations were set ... rather than kicking me out because someone else needed the table.  Definitely a customer service fail.  As good as the pizza was, I didn't feel valued as a customer so won't be back.",0
7 Numbers Restaurant,4,2020-02-14,"The service was spectacular! Really! You guys impressed me with the level of attention and care. 10/10! What disappointed me was the ratio of quality to the price of food. I paid $26 for the seafood linguine and there were 2 tiny scallops and 3 shrimps. Not good value for the money in my opinion. Grazie on Yonge, in contrast, offers better value for the money. Their prices are lower as well. My wife liked the gnocchi she ordered, but there was no promised gorgonzola cheese. She could not taste it.  The organic wine, on the other hand, was fantastic! She loved it! The calamari appetizer was DELICIOUS! Overall, a mixed bag of FANTASTIC service and mediocre value for the money when it comes to pasta. Next time, I'll go for pork chop or lamb. I'm tired of gluten and carbohydrates. I prefer protein + veggies and some legumes.",2
El Nahual Tacos,5,2020-03-24,The tacos took forever to make but they were delicious! Fresh off the grill and straight into our bellies real quick. I especially enjoyed the baja fish taco - it had just the right amount of crispiness and was not too salty like other baha fish tacos that I've tried. It was just right. What I really appreciated was that the chef personally delivered us our food. Now that's above and beyond! Would be down for coming back again.,2
Chop Chop,4,2019-01-07,"I've had my eye on this place for a while and it definitely met my expectations. It's a cute little family-owned restaurant. It had giant windows and clean decor. It was surprisingly empty on a Saturday afternoon. The servers were very friendly and attentive. 

I loved that the menu was simple and straightforward, so we weren't overwhelmed by too many choices. We ordered the braised beef noodles ($12 - they've raised the price from previously posted menus). We also got an order of pan fried dumplings to share ($9). We were really happy with everything we ordered. 

The prices are a little steeper than what you'd find in Chinatown, but their noodle portions were quite large and they gave an ample amount of beef. The restaurant was also much cleaner than the ones in Chinatown. 

I'd definitely make the trip back to try their other dishes!",2
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine,1,2019-11-09,"I have been here in three years and the quality has definitely come down.

We ordered the chicken fried rice which had no carrots or peas just rice and chicken. It tasted ok.

The sesame chicken was way too sweet and tasted like a chicken Tim bit.

The dim sum was below average for the price. There are definitely better and cheaper options. I a long time customer will not be returning.",0
King’s Tacos,3,2019-05-18,The food quality and quantity is good. They are making the fresh food for the right price. One thing they need to improve is the cleanliness of the plates and cutlery. Nice spot for Mexican food.,1

La Carnita,3,2019-02-16,"I came here for a birthday dinner on Saturday at 8pm. We were a party of 5 and didn't have a reservation so our wait time was around 1hr but only because a reservation was cancelled. If it wasn't, we probably would have waited closer to 2hrs. 
Every time I come to La Carnita, I always get the pollo frito taco but unfortunately they sold out :( I ended up getting the achiote chicken instead and I didn't read the description properly so completely overlooked the jalapeno salsa part. It was so spicy for me, I was tearing up but completely my fault for not reading the menu lol. 
The service was quick, we received our order of Mexican Corn shortly after we placed our order and our tacos came out just before we finished the corn. 

This location is a little cramped for my liking but the food quality is the same with all the other places. I've always enjoyed my dining experience at La Carnita. A reservation is strongly recommended though, otherwise you might have to wait over an hour like I did.",1
Harmoney Chinese Restaurant,1,2019-05-03,"When we arrived the restaurant was empty and silent. We were seated at a table that was sticky and bits of food left on the table. We ordered the Chinese burgers, pork soup dumplings and cold noodles. The buns were stale, the noodles were excessively greasy and had a weird texture, and the pork dumpling meat was fatty. After leaving the restaurant, both my girlfriend and I felt very uneasy, she threw up immediately. I originally decided to come to this restaurant based on the reviews but after my experience I would not recommend this to anyone.",0
Comal y Canela,3,2019-03-10,"Don't expect a Chipotle/Taco Bell type place!

Parking:  There is drive-thru parking for this plaza, but lot was full of deep potholes.  It's best to park on Macdonald Ave.  It's a small residential street, just north of Lawrence.

Restaurant itself is SMALL.  There are 4 tables and a counter with a few stools.  Restaurant opens early for Desayunos.

I believe this restaurant specialises in Michoacan food, the birthplace of canitas, low and slow cooked meats, and stews such as pozole.  Prices for specialty items were on the ""higher end"", e.g. pozole was $15 and a Michoacano Burrito (snout-to-tail, slow cooked pork), $15.  There wasn't much sauce in the burrito itself, no rice, just meat.  It was nicely cooked, but quite porkie.

Overall, the tastes are quite different than, let's say, your typical taco places downtown.  It's more about regional cooking.

Area seems a bit rough, so some of the prices did surprise me.  Ok to try, but I wouldn't drive out of my way (esp at night) to head there!",1
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine,3,2017-06-23,"Dim sum in the heart of Yorkville, honestly coming from Richmond Hill (read: right beside Markham!) I wasn't expecting much. I expected average, bland tasting classics like har gow (shrimp dumplings) and siu mai (steamed pork bites wrapped in wonton-like skin). We arrived as a table of 7 on a weekday and the place was fairly empty - understandable, dim sum usually is a longer meal not favoured for a workday lunch hour. We ordered a bit of everything and some of us were looking for specific items - everyone found what they were looking for! There were a decent variety and many classics on the menu - some that aren't often found even in Markham because they're complex to make and don't sell for high prices.

The highlights were the fritter wrapped in rice roll, the osmanthus cake, and the mini octopus in curry sauce. Often the rice rolls are squishy and lack texture, but this one was a good consistency that complemented the crunchy (not chewy!) dough fritter. The osmanthus cake came with a base layer of coconut milk, providing additional flavour and texture that agreed with the table's demands for desserts that're not too sweet but still *something*. We also ordered steamed sponge cake - it was soft and fluffy, steaming hot. The realization the sponge cake was steamed baffled some, and the softness and light flavour was well received. It could've had more of the signature taste, but it was a decent attempt at the classic.

Overall for the location I was pleasantly surprised, and prices were aligned to the area as well. Unfortunately from a dim sum in Toronto perspective, I didn't feel like it was anywhere close to great and it definitely wasn't worth the price paid. Service was good and accommodating to the non-Chinese speakers, but translations were odd and made it more difficult to understand what things were in some cases. I'll be back for team lunches looking for exotic options and a group feeling because we're all at a round table, but aside that I'll stick with my suburb options.",1
Los Guaca-Moles,1,2019-06-21,"I rarely ever review restaurants but this was extraordinarily mediocre. Fish stunk, guacamole was too hot (no flavour, just heat) and the service was slow. Don't bother",0
Bar Buca,3,2019-06-16,"Went for the 4-6 aperitivo where you get a token to fill a small plate with food for every alcoholic beverage you order. Love the concept except wish they had some non alcoholic drinks options as well (not everyone drinks!)... you can add $5 if you order a nonalcoholic drink but still want the plate of food. The drinks are all around $15... a little pricey but expected. Although you can get beer for $7. The food was pretty decent, the flatbread and lemon ricotta were my faves. Service was pretty bad though... no one checked on us. And my friend who came late and ordered didn't get her drink until like 20 min later. No one seemed to be at the bar making her drink until we reminded them and no apologies given.",1
Miku,3,2020-02-20,"Once upon a time, I was really excited to try Miku when it finally came to Toronto. My friend ended up going before me and loved it, so we decided we would do -licious together. That was a disappointing experience so I never bothered going back. Overrated.  

Fast forward a few years later and I'm back again for winterlicious but now it's $53 for dinner. I have to say Miku is consistent. I felt the same way about the food as I did the first time - mediocre. Expectations were met, but only because I was expecting much to begin with. We were seated near the front and had a view of the kitchen. I was initially shocked by the amount of kitchen staff I saw but I guess that made sense because it's a pretty big restaurant and there was a steady flow of people.   

Signature Sushi Selection (Aburi Salmon Oshi, Aburi Ebi Oshi, Coal Harbour Roll, Red Wave Roll, Aburi Ebi Nigiri and ?) - Pretty cool that you get one of each because on their menu, you can choose only choose one type (nine pieces) for around $18. Unfortunately, the pieces were bland and the rice was a little hard, as if it's been sitting out for a while. When there was flavour, it was just the sauce. The best piece would be the Aburi Ebi Nigiri and the worst were the rolls. Very AYCE tasting tbh. 

Sablefish & Lobster Ravioli - Love sablefish and it's pretty hard to mess up but this was probably the worst sablefish I've ever had. It was much firmer than I'm used to, as in when I smacked it with a fork, it didn't budge. I didn't like the lobster ravioli and there was a piece of shell in the filling. The veggies were flavourless and definitely an afterthought. 

Green Tea Opera - It's a sever layer cake and each layer is different, though it really just tastes like chocolate and red bean. Cool, cool, cool, not important. The best part of this whole meal was the matcha ice cream. The texture was more like gelato imo, super smooth, next to no air pockets, very creamy. Perfect matcha flavour, strong in matcha but not bitter and just slightly sweet. Maybe because I just had it and it's fresh in my memory, but I think this might be the best matcha ice cream I've had. 

Grapefruit Basil Smash ($7) - I liked this. Would describe it as sophisticated grapefruit juice. Stir well before drinking or you wont get the ginger beer/spiced honey part until later. Maybe it's the cup but it was a lot bigger than I thought it'd be. 

No problems with the service. Bonus info, I overheard the table next to us ask the server for their version of a California roll and it sounds like they were able to accommodate.",1
Itacate,4,2017-11-09,"Itacate is a small family run taqueria located in the west end of Toronto. It's situated inside a butcher shop on the Northwest corner of St.Clair Ave West and Oakwood Ave right across Oakwood Collegiate Institute. It's a place I have been meaning to try since it's usually on the list of hidden gem hotspots in Toronto and has gotten rave reviews for serving authentic Mexican tacos.

I ordered two tacos ($5 each tax included), a steak, cheese and onion taco and something adventurous which was a cow tongue taco. Both tacos came on a double layered soft tortilla. The tacos don't come with any dressing and you have the option of dressing the tacos with chopped onions, cilantro, hot sauce, guac and lime for drizzling.

The tacos were authentic and delicious, brought back memories of getting tacos from food stalls when I visited Mexico. Nice fresh soft tortillas, the steak, cheese and onion taco was delicious. I had never tried cow tongue before so i was expecting something chewy, the cow tongue was really soft and tender surprisingly, but could have used a little bit more seasoning.

Overall, if you are looking for a simple no frills place to have good authentic tacos, you should definitely check out Itacate. The tacos aren't cheap at $5 each tax included but the prices aren't crazy either, let's be honest, eating out in Toronto isn't cheap anymore. It's definitely a hole in the wall gem for authentic Mexican tacos.",2
Mexico Lindo,3,2016-10-29,"I would rate this place a 3.5.  The decor was greatly outdated.  The food was tasty Mexican food, nothing wrong with anything my table got.  Just be weary, if you're not into spice make sure you know what you're ordering with the waiter.  The pictures everyone has posted is exactly what we got.

In terms of the service, it was a one man show.  I get what other reviews mean about the service.  This older gentleman (maybe owner?) took the orders, showed people to their seats, bused the tables, refilled water, etc.  He did everything 2-3 waiters would do.  No surprise that getting his attention would be difficult.  We had no issues with the service.  

FYI, if your mouth is on fire from the chorizo or other spicy sauces, Hollywood Gelato is only a few buildings north.",1
Itacate,3,2018-10-18,"Were the tacos good? Definitely. Pescado, beef and pork with pineapple, all solid choices with two homemade tortillas each. 

The people were pleasant, though not overly friendly. 

Its cash only, that in my book makes things difficult. 

The wait is long, I had to wait (I was told) 25-30 mins for three tacos. To me they just need to sort out their process to get through orders faster. I understand you have one big order before me and you want to be authentic, but there must be efficiencies.

Maybe if you offered like chips while I wait it would smooth things out for me.

It's delicious and authentic like I said, but not sure I'd wait another 30 mins for tacos.",1
Famiglia Baldassarre,4,2019-06-07,"Finally came here on a Wednesday to try this unassuming fresh pasta place that I've heard so much about! It's tucked into an industrial area that isn't easily accessible (was literally a 40-min subway ride from downtown Toronto), and nested between some buildings. It's actually located next to Dark Horse Espresso, which is likewise hidden. 

My friend came here earlier than 12PM (which is when it opens) to line up, so we didn't have to wait long. In fact, even when I arrived shortly after 12, there was a line forming, but it was only about 10 people. As we didn't want to wait further, we decided to get the pasta for takeout. Since we don't need to wait for inside seating in the tiny communal area, we were therefore able to get our order faster. 

The server taking orders was super friendly, and provided great service. He had a welcoming smile and warm tone, and was able to banter casually and really well with the customers. It's an open kitchen, so you're able to see the chefs make the pasta and cook your order. Super cool!

My friend and I placed one order each of their two daily specials, and waited for about ~5-10 minutes before our food was prepared. After getting some bread from the corner to sop the pasta sauce, we grabbed a seat outdoors and dug promptly into our food.

The pasta of the day was cavatelli, and it came with either a lighter rapini / anchovy / pecorini dressing or a richer sugo and sausage tomato sauce. The first one, con cime di rapa, was honestly so good! It had a nice flavour to it - slightly salty from anchovy, and the generous amount of greens really helped to brighten the dish. The cavatelli was perfectly al dente, though I did find some pieces to err on the side of being a little under-cooked. However, if I were to choose, I did prefer the tomato-based con sugo e salsiccia. It had more depth to it, and was just heartier! For $12, the pasta is a steal. The portions are also super generous, which is great (I had enough for the next day)!

Although we were able to save time from eating out, I would likely opt to eat-in next time. The experience is just better when you're dining on plates and not from a take-out container. Also, I found my pasta getting cold and hard even a couple minutes in, likely due to the wind and exposure from the air. It wasn't a perfect experience, but that just gives me more reason to come back! Looking forward to trying the cured meats, which looked so appetizing and delicious from afar....",2
Famiglia Baldassarre,4,2019-12-10,"I don't think I could add to what others already said.
I can say prices include tax which is great. Portions are reasonable. I was at Sugo several times now and as a comparison, I don't think Sugo makes their pasta and the portions are bigger. But here you are getting quality over quantity. Pasta is made fresh that day.  So if that means anything to you then, you will make the trip.

It took 40 minutes for us to get our take out food. Went on a Wednesday. Arrived before lunch and left at 12:40pm.

They are taking Xmas orders. Order by Wednesday and pick up Saturday.

I'd like to go back",2

La Marquesita,3,2019-04-08,"4 stars for their crispy beef tacos, 2 stars for their very greasy veggie tacos. I prefer their crispy tacos to those at the Haam.

Honestly, their crispy tacos are pretty solid, but they need serve it yourself salsa to really bring them together and put them over the top. I'll probably bump this to 4 stars once they do let customers add their own salsa.

Otherwise, you'll still likely get better tacos than you're expecting from this tiny shack across from the Eaton Centre.",1
El Charro,1,2019-11-26,Can't comment on the food as I NEVER GOT MY ORDER. I ordered a shrimp burrito and waited 30 minutes. I had an appointment so I couldn't wait anymore; I asked the cashier if my order was almost ready and after looking through a pile of past orders I saw him throw the shrimp on the grill. I asked them to forget about it as really had to go. They reimbursed me cash and I left annoyed that I never ate my food and was starving. I'm not sure how they somehow forgot about my order when I was sitting right there in front of them waiting for 30 minutes! I don't think I'll give it another shot...,0
Chop Chop,5,2018-07-22,"Well, it's been a while since I've reviewed CC and now we are not only regulars, my husband considers it his fave restaurant in the city. Service is always great, their patio rocks, and we never eat anything that isn't delicious (and they change the menu enough you can always try something new). We always get a noodle dish, but we were super impressed by the eggplant and beef today ... mmm and those green beans ... and the fried tofu ... aaaaaa. They really shaped up and found themselves. We love you!! Stop selling out of the pork belly stir fry!!",2
Levetto,3,2017-11-06,"First experience: Didn't receive 'regular service' (basic) when dining in, we weren't checked on and had to get up to order another drink and ask for takeaway containers. Tried pizza & rigatoni dish.
Second experience: the following week we ordered the Rigatoni dish (with braised beef) again but for take away there was only  1/4 of the amount of meat so we felt like we paid $15 for noodles and red sauce.",1
Chop Chop,3,2018-11-10,"I give this place 3.5 stars.

This little neighbourhood hole-in-the-wall is one major black west of Chinatown proper. I like the industrial minimalist decor and the open-concept kitchen - which means you can hear the comforting sounds of food being prepared and cooked.

The menu is simple - not the 10-page ones you get at the authentic Chinese restaurants like Asian Legend. It seems they've decided just to focus on the crowd-pleaser items.

We ordered the chilli fish and the beef noodle soup. Both dishes came to the table piping hot. The chilli fish is a medium-sized plate of lightly battered, small fish fillets with a nice kick - I give it 4 stars. The beef noodle soup is a big bowl filled with (mostly) tender pieces beef, thick spaghetti-like noodles, what looked like bak choy and broth that also has a kick - I give it 3.5 stars.

The young wait staff seem eager - which is good. (Perhaps some of the more authentic Chinese restaurants like Kwan - at Yonge-St. Clair -  should have some of their waiters get pointers from Chop Chop.)

I would go back for the chilli fish.",1
Khao San Road,3,2019-06-09,"Hits and misses at one of the most popular Thai spots in the GTA. It's legacy will be for ushering in an era of outstanding and competitive Thai cuisine to Toronto... But as it currently stands, it's good but not worth the long waits.

What We Got: Pad Kee Mao (chicken), Chef Top's Massaman Curry (Tofu), Green Curry (chicken), Thai Iced Tea

What We Liked: 
+curry was smooth and solid kick
+Pad Kee Mao was a big standout - definitely one of my favourite dishes ($17)
+Chicken didn't cost extra but beef did 

What We Didn't: 
-Thai Iced Tea was smooth but missing a ""tea"" flavour, especially as the ice slowly melted. 
-Chef's curry is quite sweet - would recommend only to those who want to mix a sweet tooth with an entree. Also very heavy with plenty of potatoes
-very noisy! Hard to have conversation and hear yourself
-spice levels seemed a bit off. I swear the Pad Kee Mao at level 3 seemed to be more mild than the curry at Level 2. Felt like it was the other way around!


What We Recommend
/Pad Kee Mao! Probably will try level 4 spicy next time, but I might stick with 3 just to doubly confirm next time

Next Time...
Will probably try Pad Thai, Khao Soi and some appetizers. But let's be grateful for all these outstanding Thai options nowadays.


3.5, but I'll wait to round up based on subsequent visits!",1
Nodo Restaurant,5,2019-04-03,"GARGANELLI PASTA ----

Como En Casa,1,2019-02-08,"$16 dollars for the worst burrito bowl/platter ever, are you friggin kidding me. Maybe because it was take out but that's hardly an excuse. The portion size is just pathetic, and the chicken was pretty dry even though it was fairly flavorful. It's not value for the money at all, highly disappointing.

Mexico Lindo,1,2016-06-11,"Tried to go here for our anniversary. No one acknowledged us at the door for quite a while. When the gentleman finally asked for how many and we answered three, he told us 5 min. There were several open tables, not sure why we had to wait, especially since I'm visibly disabled. 

There was one table for two available at the front, and we watched him futz with it and add a third placemat to an already crowded table. When he motioned us over (he didn't come get us, just beckoned) I had to try to explain to him that this table was not suitable as my leg wouldn't fit. He said it was for three. I asked if we could have a four top. He said none were available. I tried again to explain that I'm handicapped and wouldn't fit at this tiny table. 

Let me be clear, there were other available tables, but they were 6 tops, and he didn't want to lose the seats. I offered to wait for a four top but he said he couldn't tell me how long that would be. 

So we left. So much for hospitality. He was rude and dismissive and I won't waste the drive again. We went next door to the seafood restaurant. It was fabulous.",0
Lai Wah Heen,2,2019-05-07,"We came here for Peking Duck around late lunch time and ended up getting dim sum.

Steamed barbecue pork bun: yes! Get this! Flavorful and light. I also enjoyed the pork shrimp and scallop siu mai.

Average items: deep fried mini shrimp ball

Things I didn't care for: deep fried dumpling of Berkshire pork and baby shrimp (tasted like a sesame ball with a filling), baked mini egg tart, steamed soft bun filled with custard, tapioca lychee and mango in chilled sweet soup

DO NOT GET: steamed short spare rib in garlic and toasted garlic. This dish was horrendous! It was slimy!

Zhang’s Kitchen,3,2020-03-14,"One cold winter afternoon... hungry... cold... wandering mindlessly downtown, I stumbled upon Zhang's Kitchen tucked in the southern side of Elm Street. 

The restaurant itself is not big and I arrived late afternoon. An eerie quietness besets the restaurant. After settling down they started putting on some mandarin pop songs and handed over water and the paper menu.  Service was courteous and efficient. 

Menu wise is extremely limited here, they specialize in yellow braised dishes.  I chose yellow braised chicken with thick noodles; a fine choice for a frigid day. The sauce that was reduced and used to braised the chicken was excellent. The simple flavours created by the cooking wine, ginger, scallion, leek, and other ingredients was delicious and would warm any stomach or heart.  The chicken was equally done well. The chicken was fall off the bones texture (even though their chicken was bone-less) without giving any feeling of it being overcooked. 

What prompted a less than four star when everything sounded great? A few things... first the noodles lacked texture. They were pretty limp and felt like overcooked store bought versions. The mushroom that was added to the dish were the wet variety and the flavour of the mushroom failed to transfer to the sauce. They also added strings of green pepper on top of the dish for aesthetic purposes. This may be a personal thing but I hate when green peppers become fully cooked (while not having been grilled). 

Overall score for Zhang's Kitchen is a solid 3.4. Unless they work on their noodles, you may want to stick with rice.",1
Sichuan Garden Restaurant,1,2016-05-21,"Inauthentic and bland. Red flags: No classic numbing spice flavor. Missed the spot on 2 signature dishes so I won't be coming back. 

The cold noodles appetizer was had noodles that were thick and tasted like spaghetti and old lard. No complimentary contents either--you can usually expect some sesame oil or thinly chopped black fungus or something but this was a low effort fail completely. 

The ""mouth watering chicken"" which is a cold chicken dish was sitting in a pool of chili oil and soy sauce (which is normal) but completely lacked flavor and spice--it should carry the sweet flavor of cooking wine, the saltiness of soy sauce and have the savory ""ma la"" numbing spice that makes your lips and tongue tingle. The only thing resembling the classic dish was the fact that the chicken was rather bony and gristly. I had to ask for more hua jiao (si chuan pepper) oil to make it edible 

I'm horribly disappointed and the two dishes cost me $14. It's overpriced at this rate. The decor is austere but rundown (fake wooden footbridge leading into banquet style restaurant that looks tatty) and I guess the fact it was empty on a Friday evening at 9 was highly suspect. Please just go to Si Chuan house cuisine if you're looking for anything nearly close to spicy",0
Donatello Restaurant,3,2019-09-21,"Donatello's has a great decor and great atmosphere. The staff were extraordinarily attentive and friendly. The cost/performance ratio of the food is however a little wanting. I had the mussels which was quite tasty but a bit skimpy for the price. The veal marsala was pretty average at best. The other notable dish was the egg plant salad which is quite imaginative with a layer of pineapple in the middle. All in all, a pleasant experience but would not rush back.",1
Ho Ho Barbeque,3,2018-04-12,"This place is pretty much the epitome of ""hole in the wall."" Tucked into a little strip mall, the restaurant is unassuming from the outside and tiny on the inside. There are no dine-in options - it's take-out only.

When you walk inside, you'll be able to see all the roast meats hanging and spinning. If the doors to the back room are open, you can even see the chefs chopping up the raw meat just two meters away. At the counter, you can see some of the side dishes on display, to help you decide what to order.

The menu has a variety of options, including duck, pork, and chicken, as well as sides such as vegetables and rice. I ended up getting the roast duck with steamed bok choy on the side. The roast duck was delicious - though quite messy to eat, due to all of the juices and bones. The steamed bok choy was lackluster.

The food was tasty and the tiny half restaurant / half butcher shop was quite an experience. It's worth a stop if you're craving some meat and aren't afraid of the grittier environment.",1
Agio,3,2019-02-15,"Foods were good and we had a good time dining as a group. Unfortunately, nearing the end of our meal, we got yelled at by the chef for being late for our reservation.

Yummy Yummy Dumplings,3,2020-02-28,"Went there because craving for dumplings and saw good reviews online. Their shop is a bit old style but that isn't a matter.

Service: Their understandings of English is really low. I know they're Asian but still communication is key especially running a business. Realized most asian restaurants nowadays required customers to write on a paper for ordering

Food: Food was delicious! Handmade and freshly made to order. Like the chewiness of the noodles and the thinness of the dumplings.

However, they gave me 11 dumplings rather than a dozen. I didn't give a tip because of the poor communication and missing food but they complained about that :/",1

Giulietta,3,2019-05-03,"Some hits and many misses; 
Always sad when slow/ inattentive or simply bad service ruins great dishes. However, the setting, the space, and the wine list are great. 

The food: although executed greatly leaves something to be desired in flavour. Simple ingredients are supposed to speak for themselves here mostly, however more ""cooked"" dishes lacked savoury or original flavours that would make you go back for specific dishes. 

The good:  Cacio e pepe is great- am I running back for it anytime, maybe. 
The disappointing: Avoid the Branzino (sea bass) if you have a problem with bones- they make no effort in deboning it before serving. 

The main issue here is service. It was exceptionally slow; had to call the staff several time for refills, orders, more wine, where's our food... etc. T
he timing between each course needed to be shortened but half if not more. I don't think they want you sitting there for 3 hours without dessert even. There were too many loooong pauses during meal staring at an empty table waiting for another round of dishes. 

With lots of great Italian options in the city I would definitely consider it more like a wine bar with a few nibbles rather than a full fledged hearty meal.",1
El Charro,2,2018-08-27,"Had an appointment across the street so I saw this Mexican place and decided to try it out. It's very nicely decorated -- vibrant colours, a mural, and lots of Mexican decor. 

I decided to go with a veggie burrito as I am vegetarian, which came up to $9 flat. I was told at the cash that it's 10% off if you pay with cash (not sure if that's an everyday thing but at least I know for next time). Anyways, I was served right away and I was in and out within five minutes I'd say. The burrito itself was not the greatest--pretty bland compared to other veggie burritos I've eaten (and I eat a lot of them lol). I've also never had a burrito with broccoli, cauliflower and carrots in it so this was a first for me . Honestly tasted like I had some type of Asian stirfry in my burrito which really threw me off. Guacamole is supposed to be included but I couldn't even taste it . To be honest I didn't finish a quarter the burrito because I just didn't enjoy it at all. A piece of the cauliflower actually fell on the ground by accident there was a bunch of pigeons around me that really enjoyed it lol  

Would I come back? Probably not. If I was in the area I'd be open to trying something else on the menu because I see a lot of great reviews but I don't see myself ever coming out of my way to come here again.",0

Artisan Plus,3,2020-01-21,"3.5/5 

Came here for a quick lunch since I heard a lot about the Yonge and finch location of this noodle spot. We were quickly sat down and  able to place our order. 

We both got the Biang Biang Mien since it was recommended by the waitress and seemed to be the most popular item from others who came to this place. 

The noodles were interesting given the variety of different toppings that you wouldn't necessarily think go together, but I liked the mixed noodles concept. My biggest issue was that despite there being so many different toppings, the noodles tastes bland and didn't have much flavour to them. It seemed like the toppings weren't cooked enough to bring out the flavours or salted enough to help. 

Overall an interesting noodle concept but I don't think I'd return again.",1
Terroni,3,2020-01-31,"We made resos for a Thursday night. Boy was this place packed! I liked the ambiance but felt like it was too noisy. I liked how it was dimly lit. 
I ordered the duck ravioli. Portion size seemed small. Sauce was good but I felt like it was missing something salty! 
My friend ordered the spicy sausage pasta which was tasty as well. She said it was al dente and the pieces of meat were good. It wasn't too salty or saucy.  
The complimentary bread was mediocre. It was cold and came in a folded paper basket. A small bowl of olive oil was hidden underneath. The olive oil was delishhh though! 
Overall it was alright. Prices are reasonable for the quality. I'm not sure if I'd go back again though!",1

I also ordered a cocktail and was surprised at the alcohol content, despite the small portion. Overall, I found the food to be really tasty and well seasoned! I just found the portion sizes to be quite small for the prices they were charging.

Our server did a great job on checking up on us and keeping up with our orders. We would occassionally just blurt out to add another item and I was impressed that they remembered it all- thank you!! Our server was also quite engaging, which made this place very welcoming and down to earth. 

The interior is decorated quite nicely and this place is very hipster. I would also recommend booking a table because, despite the numerous amounts of tables, quite a lot of them were reserved. There is also a bar for people who want to pop by for drinks only. 

The food came at a timely manner and the place was quite comfy. We were decently full but the prices really weren't worth the portion sizes we were given. This knocked back a few stars for me. Also, the bill could not be separated so figuring that out with a large group was not so favorable.

Tacos El Asador,3,2018-10-22,"Who doesn't love a good taco?

I surely do, so I was happy to meet my dining companion at Tacos El Asador, as authentic-sounding a taco joint as I've ever encountered in our fair city.

I decided to go with the Chorizo and the Birria (Goat) tacos, with the latter arriving first. I don't think I've ever eaten goat meat in the context, so I was definitely excited to give this one a try. It didn't disappoint. The meat was cooked perfectly and contained a very flavorful blend of spices, while the two sauces on the table, of which one is impressively hot, effectively enhance the taste of the concoction.

The Chorizo arrived next and while it too was quite good, it didn't blow me away like the first one. It tasted like virtually every other chorizo taco I've ever eaten; there weren't any unexpected flavors at work here, and in fact, the chorizo itself was a little bit on the bland side. I still enjoyed the heck out of it, though, especially when I added those aforementioned sauces.

I also ordered a bowl of their Chicken, Black Beans and Tortilla Soup. I'm no tortilla soup expert, so it's entirely possible this was an above-average variation, but I wasn't impressed. The broth was salty without being flavorful, while the plentiful bits of tortilla got soggy immediately and gave the dish a rather unpleasant texture. I should note, too, that the soup comes with a fairly hefty amount of cheese, which definitely should have been indicated on the menu.",1
98 Aroma,1,2019-06-09,"Oh my God!! How did they get high ratings!!????? They had sectional sittings and some open areas. The place is dark for a Chinese restaurant. The decor is mostly wooden plaques and wood carvings. 

The servers or staff there were not friendly and talked behind your back. Yes, I understand Mandarin even though I spoke English to them!! I had to get up twice to get their attention and they only had three tables with customers. 

It's supposed to be fine dining so I had a feeling that the portion would be smaller. Ok. But why all the saltiness in your dishes!!! The veggie dish was pricey and decent. The shrimp fried rice lacked the shrimps. They were tiny!! The rice was hard. It felt more of a Caucasian dish. The beef and broccoli dish was the largest dish full of salt!! Basically eat and drink lots of water. 

I was obviously not satisfied or full. Dishes were TOO SALTY, even my friend didn't like them. 

Never will I go back!",0
Trattoria Nervosa,4,2019-05-22,"TL;DR Decent Italian food with fresh ingredients, good price for Yorkville

Came on a Saturday at lunch, no wait for walk-in, shared 2 dishes as we weren't hungry. 

Kale salad 4.5/5 - Possibly one the best kale salads we've ever had. Comes with finely chopped kale soaked in vinaigrette. The combination of dried berries and pine nuts is what made this dish so tasty. Highly recommend

Branzino 4/5 the fish itself was tender and beautifully made. The green sauce of herbs and lemon is also delicious. The issue was that not enough salt or acid was in the dish, thus was lacking flavour.",2
Fusaro’s Kitchen,3,2017-12-10,"I ordered the Siciliana pasta. For the prices that everything is on the menu, it's definitely worth it. We all got a pretty big portion. In terms of taste however, it didn't really blow me away. 

Although the food took quite some time to get to us (30 minutes) the service was great. I had this waitress from Ireland who was quite nice. When I wasn't sure of which wine to get, she also brought me tasters. 

Overall, it's a good place for fairly cheap Italian food but it didn't blow my socks off.",1
Trattoria Nervosa,2,2020-05-15,"My boyfriend and I used to go to Trattoria Nervosa all the time, it closed down a couple of times for ""renovations"" so we havent been in a while. We just ordered from them after they opened up post-COVID era and were supremely disappointed with the food. The prices stayed the same but the portions were significantly smaller and the crust for the pizza wasnt as good as it used to be. You used to be able to smell truffles when you walked in the restaurant, I couldnt even taste them at all on the pizza. They also got rid of the beef carpaccio and the risotto nervosa which were a couple of our favourite dishes! :(",0
La Marquesita,5,2019-05-03,"I got a marquesita with cheese and Nutella and it was delicious! I have never tried this before. It had cheese and Nutella and then more Nutella all over the outside. I would also like to try the strawberry and cheese. We also tried their tacos which are great and cheaper than the competition in Kensington. I will definitely be back! It seemed busy and popular, and the guys making the food were friendly.",2
MEXITACO,3,2020-02-10,"I've been to Mexitaco a couple of times now and they've been good enough. The servers are friendly but not as attentive as I'd like, make sure to really confirm what you've ordered to ensure nothing has been missed and if something doesn't arrive soon, check with your server because it probably wasn't punched in. The atmosphere is fun but small, and busy on weekends, so make reservations if you have a group. 

The nachos with added guacamole is good but don't expect much cheese happening with these, it's mostly tomatoes, onions, and sour cream; the added guacamole really helps, but wish their guacamole was thicker because it's very slurry like.

The elote was not good here. It didn't look or taste like it was actually grilled, plus the mayonnaise and shredded cheese combination grossed me out. I've tried other Mexican style street corn that are much better.

Out of the tacos I've tried, the baja fish is my favourite, followed by the carne asada. I find their tacos are on the drier side so make sure to really use the supplied limes, salsa, and hot sauce provided after you order. I would not recommend the baja calamari taco, it was 3 sad tiny battered calamari rings (like the sad frozen ones) that were also chewy and flavourless. 

The frozen margarita with added Coronita was unexpectedly salty, so I would not recommend. Try their Pina Colada instead - can be a hit or miss.

We've tried other things on the menu that are okay but this is what we will typically order every time and basically what not to order for next time.",1
Good Hombres,3,2020-05-04,"After reading that they make their tortillas in- house, I was excited to come here for some tacos. For lunch, I ordered the chamberete (beef shank) and pescado (haddock). ""S"" on the menu indicates the taco is spicy. Since I have low heat/spice tolerance, I asked if they could make it mild. 

The tacos were smaller than other taco joints, but they are cheaper in price ($3.75 vs. $5-8). The tortilla was thin and soft yet it was still able to hold the filling/topping.

In terms of flavours and the protein, I didn't find it too memorable. The beef shank was a bit dry but the haddock was freshly fried.

Whilst sitting at the bar waiting for my food, I noticed that the staff worked like a well-oiled team!",1
Dumpling House Restaurant,1,2019-12-06,"This was my second time dining at this establishment, but mark my words it is the last! While eating an order of noodles I was splitting with my gf I came across a COCKROACH!!!!!  

When I confronted the owner he looked down at my plate and saw the roach and quickly took my plate and dashed to the kitchen before I had a chance to take a photo.

The only funny and bewildering part to this is that a group of people standing behind me waiting to be seated saw what had happened and witnessed the roach in my noodles and still decided to stay and dine !!!!

FAIR WARNING TO ALL, DO NOT EAT HERE!!! COCKROACHES ARE ALSO DINING AMONG YOU!!!",0
Banh Mi Boys,3,2020-02-20,"Not authentic!! It's a good sandwich with good fillings. The bread however, is what makes a Banh mi a Banh mi and it was too soggy. Really good Banh mi bread is just perfect crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. This is not it. The fries were okay as well. Also too soggy. Sigh.",1
Sichuan Garden Restaurant,1,2020-02-10,"This restaurant was formerly known as ""Sichuan Garden Restaurant"" and re-opened last year as ""Ten Miles B.B.Q"".  After reading positive reviews about their Dan Dan Noodles and Sichuan cuisine I popped in alone for a quick lunch.  I was greeted with a very confusing menu.   I wanted to order a few sides, but was advised by the server that my selections were too small. She did not suggest any alternatives.  All of the multiple small plates seem to have only one ingredient and no options for combination dishes like a mixed vegetable platter. I am happy to pay more for more content, but $12 for just bok choy? $6 for one small skewer of basic mushrooms? had to call her over twice until she finally helped me narrow it down to Dan Dan Noodles and a mushroom pot. I was hungry and desperate to order anything at this point.  THEY GAVE ME THE BILL BEFORE THE FOOD ARRIVED.  The Dan Dan Noodles were tasty, but after that the server and kitchen staff seemed to prioritize take out orders over mine.  At about 45 mins + from when I walked I had to flag two servers to ask about the mushroom pot I had ordered.  The kitchen staff had only just started the dish! At that point I paid for what I had eaten and walked out.    If you want UNHELPFUL ,SLOW & UNATTENTIVE servers and kitchen staff that (prioritize Uber Eats orders over sit down guests) and don't own up to their mess ups than you might enjoy this restaurant.  I myself will NEVER RETURN.  There are thousands of restaurants in the GTA. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY on this one! P.S. The management was non-existent. P.P.S. THEY GAVE ME THE BILL BEFORE I HAD EVEN RECEIVED THE FOOD!",0
Como En Casa,2,2018-03-27,"Two words can summarize my thoughts on the food here: overpriced and bland. I was super stoked to try Como En Casa because (1) I LOVE Mexican food and (2) fellow Yelpers have given this place such glowing reviews. We placed a takeout order on a Friday night. I ordered a small chicken burrito and my husband ordered a large verde burrito with beef. When I called and placed the order on the phone, the person asked me ""if guacamole was okay"". I said yes. To my chagrin, the guacamole was an extra charge, and we ended up paying nearly $30 for two burritos. I recognize that it's partly my fault for not checking if guacamole was extra, but I thought the way that I was asked suggested it was included, and they were asking if I wanted it on my burrito. Just seemed kind of slimy, if you ask me. 

All of this (including the high-ish price tag) would have been fine if I enjoyed my burrito. Negative. The meat was incredibly dry and bland. I barely had any chicken in my burrito, and if I did manage to snag some meat, it tasted like chewy old chicken. The burrito was mostly rice with, like, one piece of lettuce. I barely tasted a tomato or anything to break up the rice. I didn't notice any beans or sour cream. Honestly, this was a terrible burrito. I think I'm pretty easy to impress with Mexican food, but this was just horrible. My husband didn't like his either. I won't be wasting my precious Friday-night cheat meal on this place.",0
Chula Taberna Mexicana,3,2019-11-11,"We decided to drop by on a late Saturday night, the place was busy but we were lucky to wait only 15 minutes. We ordered the Street Corn, Beer Battered Haddock Tacos, Crispy General Tao Tacos, BBQ Beef Brisket Taco and Pork Shoulder Burrito. 

The Street Corn came out - and was absolutely delicious! The cream sauce on top was the perfect sauce for it. 
When the tacos came out, the Crispy General Tao Taco's sauce seemed to have drenched all the other ones as well, so the tacos were very soggy, and didnt leave much of an impression. Out of the three the Haddock was definitely the best.  Lastly, we the burrito came out, and that was delicious. The salsa, the rice, and meat were so tender it came together perfectly. Overall we enjoyed our dinner at Chula, and would probably come back to check it out in the summer on their patio. We found the indoor restaurant to be a bit cramped (especially the front of the house).",1
GB Hand-pulled Noodles,3,2019-10-06,"This was my first time ever getting hand-pulled noodles. The broth was lovely - reminded me of pho. I ordered the super thin noodles, & it seemed almost over cooked as they were too soft. I suppose this might just be because they're super fresh, so there's no way to make them more al dente. I found because it's hand pulled, the size consistency of the noodles were off. There were thicker noodles mixed in, so it threw me off. This is most likely all PREFERENCE based.. but the beef was GREAT & the flavours of the broth and addition of green onions and cilantro.",1
Asian Legend,1,2017-10-17,"Without question the worst cashew nut chicken I ever unfortunately ordered...
Smaller than most restaurants portions, to top it off; $18.01 for garbage food.
There are many WRONGS in this world; a bad meal is pretty low in the grand scheme of things/life.  BUT; a garbage meal is still a garbage meal.  Staff looked miserable, absolutely unpleasant.  I don't need an ass-kissing or TLC at a fast food Chinese restaurant, this was depressing.  Waste of money, waste of time.",0
Swatow Restaurant,3,2019-08-03,"One of the OG restaurants of Toronto's Chinatown. It is a classic ""hole in the wall"" that has stood the test of time. The surrounding area is slowly but surely undergoing gentrification.  I remember a lot more Chinese supermarkets and aunties selling vegetables and other items along the streets. 

The restaurant is small and cramped. If you have a seat near the kitchen doors, be prepared for the stench every time the door swings open. You don't come here for the ambiance/service. You come here for Chinese food. 

Washrooms are in the basement, as with most restaurants in the area. 

Service is as expected from a Chinese restaurant. Effective. 

Ordered:
""Fish sliced noodle soup"": I chose vermicelli, which is thin rice noodles. The ""fish sliced"" is actually a blend of mystery fish made into a cube pre-cooked and sliced. It's probably the same item used for hotpot. Instead of this topping, I'd recommend the fish balls (you really taste the ""fishiness""). 

The soup is clear and very mild in flavour. It's not overly salty. A plus is the vegetables that accompany the soup. 

Observing the other tables' chow meins, rice dishes etc., I believe Markham Chinese food / Congee Queens provide much better value (quantity:price ratio)",1
Taverna Mercatto,3,2019-03-29,"i tried this place out on a week night for my birthday w.3 of my gfs. we ordered 4 pasta dishes and a charcuterie board to share. our server (short redish hair) didnt seem enthused all night..not sure if thats just how she was..but definitely not on the friendly side. she seem quite hostel towards us than the other server we saw.. but we made our own night fun w.each other! 
service 3/5.

the salami charcuterie board was ok..nothing in particular wowed us with it. she brought it out and dropped it on our table. no explaination as to what was what..didnt know which salami/cured meat was which..didnt even know which cheese selection they had given us either.. it wouldve been nice to know what we were feasting on..i know my friend requested more salami and a cheese that wasnt so strong. i think they gave us brie cheese..

we then got the 4 pastas: orecchiette, bolognese, pappardelle & carbonara.
all of it was really good! forgot to ask for the pastas to be cooked a little more well but the flavours are nice.
braised rabbit was tender. fennel sausage had a nice kick. bolognese meat sauce was delicious carbonara wasnt overly creamy.

overall food 4/5.

atmosphere was nice. dim lit, cute little lights hung through out. lots of seating and tables throughout the place. not sure how busy it would be on a weekend..but id love to come back and try their pizzas!",1
Lai Wah Heen,5,2018-09-01,"This was the best dim sum I've had in a very long time. It is the most authentic HK dim sum for all the dishes I ordered. After having a mediocre dim sum recently I was very Happy to have come here. Only thing is that I don't live here... 

The steam bao bun was fluffy and had a decent amount of filling. The egg tart was my favorite as it was warm and the custard was nice and rich. The pork belly was an additional bonus. Will have to come and order the Peking Duck on my next visit. Service was great too!!!

Highly recommend. A tad pricey but worth it in IMHO. Can't wait for my next visit!",2
Ha Gow Dim Sum House,3,2019-08-13,"We have been here for takeout a few times here. Remember its CASH ONLY so pack those 20 bills. I really liked their dim sum sampler, with classic dumplings like shrimp and seafood. I would recommend the dim sum sampler over their dishes.",1
Yummy Yummy Dumplings,3,2020-02-09,"The service was great, but the quality of the food was pretty mediocre. Tried 4 different kinds of dumplings - neither of them were bad, but didn't stand out either.",1
GB Hand-pulled Noodles,3,2019-12-15,"I have to give credit where credit is due - GB Noodles is the restaurant that made me a noodle-soup fan. I lived in China from 2015-2017, and while I was there, I didn't find a noodle soup I enjoyed. 

GB Noodles changed all of that. I used to love coming here. It was consistently delicious.

I'm not sure what's changed, but it definitely isn't the soup I remember. It's still good, don't get me wrong, but after coming back for the first time in about a year, I'm just not sure what's changed. The broth is decent, the noodles are still fantastic, but the overall effect left me a bit wanting.",1
Blu Ristorante,3,2019-09-15,"I'm really not trying to be passive aggressive but honestly, this is my interpretation of this restaurant and the patrons who have rated it so highly.  I feel it received the acclamation it has (voted one of most romantic restaurants in the city and all the 5 star ratings) because (a)  it's in Yorkville and (b) guests MAY mostly include those that don't dine out in the city as often.  The ones that usually do on special occasions

Look, this city has an abundance of fantastic restaurants led by a generation of daring, creative and exciting chefs.  So when I come to Blu, that is a self proclaimed ""fine dining"" restaurant, I'm expecting everything to be elevated.  Not everyone can be Alo, I get it, but it's the expectation that's set which I'm comparing the experience to.  

For starters we got carpaccio, tuna tartar and the octopus. The carpaccio was your typical combination of flavors that I can recite in my sleep (meet, Capers, some creamy sauce, truffle oil ,arugula for garnish.  Maybe not exactly but you know what I mean).  The tartar was tasty from what I recall but the ""octopus"" omg.  First off they seemed to be 2 squid tentacles, very small and burnt.  On one side is a pineapple chutney of sorts and on the other side is an eggplant purée.  It's octopus! Can't really mess that up and don't ever pair is with anything so overpowering. The eggplant ok fine maybe but the Indian flavors did not complement the fish at all.  

On to main course.  My wife had the wild boar ragu.  First couple of bites and you're thinking wow this is delicious but I could see where my wife was coming from when she said the sweetness in that dish is just too much.  You almost get sick of it near the end.  But she ate most of it and whatever it was fine.  I had the seafood pasta.  It was good.  Fresh seafood, pasta and light olive oil sauce.  Nothing extra just what you'd expect I guess.  

The ambiance is great and we loved the service.  They have a nice drink menu and prices were what you'd expect for Yorkville.  

Overall is was a great night and my wife and I didn't leave the restaurant angry.  We enjoyed the food but again it's setting the expectation.  Everything we ate tasted like how they should and we've had those same flavors many times before.  but we were expecting more imagination with flavors and presentation.  Unfortunately Blu didn't deliver",1
La Carnita,3,2019-11-23,"We went on a Friday night and the wait was 40 minutes, so we decided to explore the area near us until we received a text that our table was ready. They led us to our table only to find that people were still sitting there. It took them 15 minutes to figure out another table for us. When we finally sat down, we were given menus and the food here is not cheap at all. We decided to get some chips and salsa to share with 2 tacos each. The salsa came in a tiny container that was barely enough for one person. We waited another 45 minutes for the tacos for them to be cold.",1
Good Hombres,5,2019-08-08,"Love this place!

House of Gourmet,3,2019-04-19,"House of Gourmet is a great spot for late night Chinese food with huge portion at reasonable price! However, don't expect anything extraordinary because you get what you pay for. 

On all of my visits, even ones at 2AM, the place was constantly busy so service always seemed so rushed. The restaurant offers a several options of typical Chinese dishes such as dumplings, fried noodles/rice, soup, etc. My go-to is definitely seafood congee! It is cooked to just the right consistency, not too watery or too thick. Seafood includes shrimp, fish fillet, abalone, scallop, squid and small pieces of ginger that really brings out the flavor! The portion for a small congee is super filling that will likely keep you full until the next meal. I've also tried their noodles soup with BBQ duck & BBQ a few times but it was meh. One time I'd find the broth to be too bland, and other times it was so salty. Other than that, the noodles also comes with generous amount at decent price.

Overall, House of Gourmet is definitely a good choice for late night food, but the quality doesn't really stand out from other restaurants.",1
Ho Ho Barbeque,2,2020-04-10,"Ordered a whole roast duck. One of the worker says to me that he had to cut the duck inside the kitchen. While I came home and opened the take out boxes, one of the box was full but the other box was half full and there were a lot of ducks's necks to replace the empty space. I have assumed they stole some of the goods part of the duck for their combo rice meal and they make $$$ out of that. No wonder that they had to cut the duck inside the kitchen so that you can not see what they are stealing. I had call my friends and they say the same thing.  The duck was good and you can taste the freshness and was not frozen but you lost me as a customer for life. The reasons why I brought the roast duck from them at that time because the other two Chinese roast meat place in the same area was closed due to Covid 19 and they was the only place open for Chinese roast meat. Words of month travel very fast and your business will suffer because of this unethical practice.
Now I know how they are able to sell the rice combo meals so cheap.

Tacos, fresh tortilla chips, AMAZING guacamole, so many ingredients made fresh in house, and the spicy sauces are actually spicy! The tortillas are fresh and delicious as well. 

We ordered a huge takeout order for our office, and they made it very quickly! Everything was well organized and it was a hit! I can't recommend this restaurant enough. I will definitely be coming back.",2
Chop Chop,2,2019-04-05,We ordered through Uber eats. The driver was quick and really friendly. The food was hot and not too expensive. Otherwise the food was not our favorite.

Buca Yorkville,2,2019-10-18,"We ordered three pasta dishes all of them were mediocre; lobster, vongole and octopus. Lacking flavor and pasta overcooked. Very skimpy on the seafood. Fail. Never again. Not worth the calories. Very disappointed and I'm a carb/pasta whore.",0

It is an open seating arrangement with 4 large picnic tables and the food carts around it. It was a nice sunny, windy day, perfect to get some spicy food.  Between the three of us we got

CHICKEN TEQUITA: a deep fried taco with guacamole and chicken. Could have been slightly more spicy. It was well marinated. 

CARNITAS TORTAS: this was delicious, a big CARNITAS loaded sandwich served with some nachos on the side. 

I like my Mexican to be slightly more spicy and a little more tangy, this was alright but I have had better and would keep experimenting till I find the flavor.",1
KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL,3,2020-02-08,"For a party of 3, we ordered 3 set meals and 2 drinks, and we left with our stomachs pretty full. This is my 3rd time at this location, but unfortunately stars were docked off for quite an uncomfortable experience. 

Made a reservation for a party of 3 for 6:30pm on a Tuesday, what we were given was a small table for 2 with a small stool at the side of our table, with my back to the adjacent customers table at a corner, which essentially felt like I was in the middle of the walkway. Throughout the entire dinner, I had felt extremely awkward and uncomfortable as I had felt the waiters/waitresses' bodies touching mine every time they came by to serve food to the table behind me. We've requested 2 times, when the restaurant was not packed for a larger table, but nothing was to be done. Unsurprisingly, I felt like we were being rushed in finishing our plates one right after the other as there were no room at all to fit any dishes anymore. 

If we had proper seating and space, I believe the experience would have been that much greater.",1
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,3,2020-04-20,"This place is a small hole in the wall and worth visiting if you crave some good old fashioned tacos rather than the commercial stuff.. portion sizes were good however the flavours were slightly missing for me.. 

I would visit them again if I was in the area, but not necessarily my go to place. Please don't let my review deter you from trying their tacos though, they are still pretty good. 

Flavours can be very subjective and this place is definitely worth a try.. but if you know and love tacos and taco culture as much as me, then you would also know that everyone has their own go to spot.. 

This place has great service, friendly staff and a small seating area if you just want to eat quickly or grab'n'go.",1

We heard the default spicy level (which is 2) for the mala pot is too spicy, but apparently my friend who told me that is a baby lol. I don't eat very spicy but this is definitely not spicy at all, I would suggest go for level 3. We ordered the marrying four pot, funny name huh, but it has beef sirloin, pork, lamb and shrimp, which basically saves u lots of decisions! We also added lotus root, beef balls, and rice cake. The rice cake was a great add on , it's crispy outside and soft inside, it absorbs the flavors and it's amazing! Even though it is not that spicy, I definitely think it is very very delicious, I would definitely come back again to try more dishes! We also ordered stir fry potato, it's warm and spicy, it's great!",2

One really cool thing seemed to happen when I was there - someone came in to pick up an order, and brought her own reusable containers. There was some back and forth, I think about how they had been cleaned, but sure enough, they went back to the kitchen and out came her order packed to go.

It's more of a fast food type setup than Mother's, but there's a bit of seating, and you can sit and eat no problem. The menu's just on display screens, from what I could tell, but it had a good number of options. 

And the prices are outstanding value.",2
Khao San Road,3,2019-06-23,"Food: 4/5
Service: 3.5/5
Decor: 3/5
Price: 4/5

Small and quaint. When entering there was a sign warning about bugs that may look like cockroaches inside the restaurant. It says to not be alarmed they are not cockroaches and it is natural during the summer days for these little insects to find their way indoors. If spotted you can call a waiter to come by and they will sweep them up and take them outdoors. 

The menu's are suuuuper dirty. They do not wipe them down at all! There's tons of grit and its sticky on all 3 of our menu's. The pricing wasn't too clearly shown. For the main's its all the same price located at the very top $16.95 and then you can add on your different meats for a dollar or 2 on top. 

We got two appetizers the garlic shrimp and the fried chicken. They were both delicious!. For the mains the green curry was okay, we got it with beef. Big mistake, their beef is extremely tough! it was super dry, felt like it's been cooked for days and kept in the fridge to be warmed up in a microwave and tossed into the curry to serve. The 3 flavours pad thai was good. had a lot of flavour and ingredients as well. The best out of the 3 was the Khao Soi, i got that one with chicken. Delicious. No complaints. 

We let the waitress know about the really tough beef and she just took the dish and brought it to the kitchen without saying a word. After a few minutes she came back and said she would switch the curry to chicken instead. We agreed and she took the plate back inside. It was a pretty busy night so taking awhile for the food to come out is understandable. I shared the Khao Soi and waited for the green curry to come out. By the time we finished our food it finally came. We just asked for it to-go. 

The service i would say is about a 3.5, she seemed as though she was just rushing through everything without talking with the customers. Food took quite a while as well. I would go back to try their other menu items.",1
El Nahual Tacos,4,2020-02-13,"Last Saturday, I sampled a number of food items from different food stalls at the Annex Food Hall. I have been on a taco kick since late December 2019. It must have been eating all that Christmas turkey and wanting a change. Naturally, I had to try what El Nahual Tacos had to offer.

I had already had some food from Mean Bao. Although the deal for three tacos for $13 was mighty appealing, I didn't want that much food. Instead, I went with the fish taco, and chips and salsa. Perfect!

The fish is cod in the taco. I'm good with a flaky fish. I waited for a bit for my order. Moments later, my food was ready.

The fish taco was delicious. I love how fresh the fish was. The batter was thin and crispy, which it should be. The taco was perfect and the flavours in the taco were spot on. The chips were hot out of the fryer. The salsa had mild cilantro in it. It was okay, but I was hoping for more of a tomato version of salsa. I still ate it all.

I was with a number of friends that evening. We ended up getting more tacos, and chips with salsa. So much food! I grabbed a pulled beef taco. I give it full marks for tenderness. However, it was super salty for my liking. I remember feeling thirsty afterwards and drinking a ton of water to balance my system out. I then felt bloated... haha!

I'd love to try more tacos here. I have the inclination that the pulled versions of their proteins are heavy on the sodium, so I'll steer away from them. The food is yummy here, despite that minor setback.

Eataly,5,2020-02-18,"Second visit to dine at Eataly was amazing. This time it was at ""La Piazza"". Quoted 35 minutes for the wait on a Sunday late afternoon.

Shared a soppressata and funghi pizza with a glass of Aperol Spritz. Both pizza options were delicious. Not your typical thin crust, wood oven pizza but something thicker and softer in texture to consume.

Impeccable service as always.",2
DaiLo,3,2019-09-23,"Good food and unique flavours but found it a bit pricey for whats it worth. Came here on a Sunday evening to a somewhat empty restaurant that filled up slowly throughout the night. Dishes were flavourful but expensive. The portions are also quite small so if you want to fill up, you'll need to spend quite a bit. I may personally struggle a bit with fusion Chinese restaurants as I often find similarily tasty food for significantly cheaper in traditional restaurants. 

Worth a try but I won't be a regular!",1
Khao San Road,3,2020-01-13,"Well my wife and I finally got around to try the new location of Khao San Road on Charlotte St. I love the decor and design of this location very interesting use of space, at first I thought there was only maybe room for about 20 people but as our server took us around the corner there was more seating for about another 20 to 30 people. The ambiance is really loud here and the back tables are mainly long high tops so plan to share with other people. 

The service is ok nothing too over the top but I give them a benefit of a doubt cause it was lunch time and it was full house and the servers were all running around. It didn't take long to flag our server down for some additional napkins, however our water glasses were empty and no one came around to refill until we asked. 

The food was ok as well we had ordered the Garlic Tofu and Garlic Chicken to start. Both appetizers were very crunchy and crispy the garlic taste was a bit muted in my opinion both also come with a ramekin of the typical Thai sweet chili dipping sauce. Very crunchy exterior which locked in all the juice inside.

I ordered the Pad Gra Prao with beef add $1 and fried egg add $1 which is basically a dry curry with beef, red peppers, onions, red and green chili peppers and also a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg on top of white jasmine rice. I found that the beef was slightly too salty and too dry. Overall 3.5 / 5 for me. 

We also ordered the Khao Soi which is a soup noodle with egg noodles in a curry based soup. We opted to get the beef option for an additional $1. The presentation was really nice flavours were good slightly on the sweet side for my liking but when lime juice is added the flavour sort of balanced itself out. I think this is a 4 / 5 for me.

Overall just another Thai restaurant in the city that serves authentic Thai food. But didn't really blow me away.

Los Guaca-Moles,3,2019-07-07,"The service was great and the ambiance was nice too. I most definitely will come back for drinks.

However, the food was too pricey and the portions too small - it wasn't worth it.
My boyfriend got the Alambre vegetariano for $18, which consisted of 3 tiny tacos filled with a bit of veggies and a small rice tower next to it. For that price he was expecting a nice and filling meal, not a sad appetizer sized meal.",1
Byblos,2,2019-08-09,"Food was nothing special and food took a while to come out. We had the fried chicken - which lacked flavour nothing too great to be raves about. As sides we ordered the cauliflower and Brussels sprouts - which basically tasted like boiled vegetables which also lacked flavours. 
Overall wasn't super impressed, the only thing nice was really the inside of the restaurant with the aesthetics

Enoteca Sociale,3,2019-08-01,"It's become increasingly clear that ambiance plays almost as big a role in my enjoyment of a meal as the food itself, and this concept was certainly illustrated in spades during my time at Enoteca Sociale.

We arrived around 6:00 on a weekday, and though we didn't have a reservation, we were immediately shown to a table on the patio.

It's a nice patio, admittedly, but there are definitely some problems. The biggest and most obvious issue is the lack of space between the tables. We were sitting between two other tables and there was probably only a few inches separating us and our neighbors. It was less than private, to put it mildly.

We were also sitting underneath some trees and there was some sap or something that kept falling. The diners to our left actually wound up moving because of it, and my dining companion wound up with some gross-looking stuff on her shirt.

It's not exactly an atmosphere conducive to enjoying a quiet, romantic meal, is my point.

Anyway, in terms of the food, Enoteca Sociale is definitely an above-average destination. We were presented with some complimentary bread to snack on, and it was delicious. The bread was fresh and tasty, while the accompanying oil contained a smokiness that I found irresistible.

For my main, I went with the Amatriciana (""Guanciale, tomato, Pecorino Romano & chili""), and aside from the fact that it's an almost comically small portion (I think I ate the whole thing in about two minutes), this is definitely a top-notch bowl of pasta. The tomato sauce contains exactly the sort of deep richness that one covets, while the pasta itself was cooked quite well. The concoction could've been hotter (i.e. it was probably sitting for a few minutes before I got it), but otherwise I really dug the heck out of this.

It's just too bad about that ambiance.",1
Buca,1,2019-10-20,"Service was horrible. I cant explain with the words. We waited a lot for everything. The bill came 15 minute after I asked. Pasta was extremley small but i cant understand this shit. Why dont you put more pastocon the plate ? Pasta is super cheap thing also there is no cheaper pasta than $22. Like just put some more that than i can say it worth! 

Terrible experience I dont reccomend to people go there.",0
Quetzal,3,2019-12-03,"I was very excited about trying Quetzal. Upon arrival the ambiance was great, with candlelit tables and a curved ceiling, like being inside of a ship. The bar seating was inviting and the drinks menu was inventive and cocktails were superior with great notes for sipping.

For the food we did the tasting menu, since there were many unique dishes that we wanted to try. The sea bream and scallop ceviche was underwhelming, with the scallops being were quite small and not fresh tasting. The other sushi grade fish - the kanpchi tiradito - was good in comparison. The thin crispy Masa round was similar to a taco pizza, and a fun app to share. 

Next up, the kale salad was tasty and served with the full stems. The bone marrow came with two large bones but didn't seem to have enough flavour cooked into it. Lastly, the skirt steak and 18oz rib eye were served. We were never asked how we liked it cooked when ordering, but we received medium rare which worked out to our tastes. 

Overall, great value for a lot of food and high quality ingredient based dishes, but nothing stood out at the end of the night. I was hoping for a little more bite. 

It's a beautiful restaurant otherwise, and maybe I'm just not the right fit for palette.",1
Mexico Lindo,2,2017-10-25,"The decor is nice and the atmosphere feels right, but this place lacked a bit of service attention. 

We dropped by for a quick bite as we love Mexican food. We ended up ordering the fajitas for two. It was a large portion of meat (we got chicken and chorizo mix) but there were only 5 (five) tiny tortillas... that didn't make sense to me. 2 or us, lots of meat, but very few tortillas...we asked and we had to pay to get more, which I thought was not reasonable. I didn't get more cause I'm cheap. Also, we got a tiny container of sour cream. 

Overall it felt like they offered very little in terms of condiments. 
I waited a good 5-10 minutes to get more napkins and some hot sauce (Something good and spicy) but no luck. I ended up getting up and walking to the front to ask for it. Overall the service wasn't great. 
The fajitas were good but nothing out of this world. The selection of Mexican beers was also limited. 
We will have to keep looking for the ultimate Mexican Food place!",0
Mariachi’s Restaurant,3,2018-07-24,"It was fun get together at Mariachis last week when me and my friends decided to go here. 
We primarily wanted to try the spicy margaritas. We got the jalepeno cucumber pitcher and the spicy pineapple one. Both were delicious. They got us the frozen style margaritas and I am not sure if they have the on the rocks option. 

During summer they have seating outside which is a small space with quite a few tables in the area. A decent place to sit, however it can get crowded. The place is located on the main road so it's easily accessed. 

We ordered food chicken fajita and our friends got the enchiladas. The fajita were a bit too saucy and wasn't really crisp. We also got some guacamole and that was delicious. So foodwise it was so-so but for drinks it was a really fun place to be!",1
Nodo Restaurant,3,2018-06-24,"For such a charming looking restaurant with high ratings, I had big hopes for Nodo. I loved the decor and set up, which I describe as a rustic boho chic. However, the food fell short of expectations and did not taste very authentic at all. I ordered the tradition gnocchi recommend by our server, it was so so. My friend had better luck with the fish. We shared the tiramisu for dessert, but that was also underwhelming and we only ate a quarter of it. The portions are fairly large if that helps.",1
Carisma,2,2019-01-10,"Disappointed.

I came here for dinner and the experience was underwhelming overall. 

The ambience is nice. The service was adequate and efficient. However, the food was disappointing. The food wasn't bad, but just not what I expected for the price.",0
Byblos,3,2019-09-14,"The food and cocktails were exceptional. Truly. We tried the ahi tuna, beets with labneh, black truffle rice, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, marcona almonds and olives. All delicious and beautiful.  

Unfortunately, our server was a bit snooty. She didn't seem to approve of our ordering style, which was surprising considering the menu seemed to emphasize shareables. We preferred to try many small plates as opposed to a main. Nonetheless, she kept pushing for more; insisting the sides and rice were meant to be paired with a main protein.",1
Taverna Mercatto,4,2020-01-29,"Omg - orecchiette was so amazing. Freshly made
Little ears pasta with fabulous  sausage and the right amount of spice and pesto - yum! Beet and ricotta salad was pretty good too - bUt I'm not a fan of a big blob of ricotta on things. Just add to selective bites and  leave the rest.
Got the cannolo for dessert too and it was amazing. Stop by here and ask what to order as itt  did not disappoint. I will Jones for the pasta when I am not in Toronto!",2
Trattoria Nervosa,3,2019-03-24,"This is a very cute restaurant in the heart of Yorkville on the corner of Yorkville Avenue. 

Like most of the reviewers, I went for the popular dish, Malafalde di Funghi. This pasta dish tasted as good as it looked. It's creamy and the pasta was al denté. 

We sat on the main floor, which was buzzing on Friday afternoon. Next time, I'd like to check out the rooftop patio when the weather is nicer. 

The price is mid to higher end, which I'm not crazy about. And after reading other people's reviews, the taste for other highlighted dishes seemed more conflicted (less consensus -except for the dish I got), so this wouldn't be a go-to spot for me. 

Atmosphere is on point. It's not stuffy like most of the restaurants in Yorkville. It feels homey.

The server we had was super busy, but he did what he needed to do. He was very on point with pouring our champagne and always made sure our glasses were filled. 

Overall, it was a pleasant experience.",1

Carisma,3,2019-07-04,"Not feeling it for the new fancy location.

Love the old location with old friendly staff than the new ones.  The price is more expensive, and the food is not as good.  The new staff didn't know about serving / dinner etiquette.  Serving both left and right side.  With the lower food quality and higher price tag / seemed more fancy environment will look for more.  The owner is still there and he has to work hard and busy himself by telling the new younger staff what needs to be done.

Really disappointing that the food was not as good as before (far from it).",1
Bang Bang Ice Cream and Bakery,5,2019-08-04,"We've waited about 45 minutes on line for this. I would say it was worth the wait! The place itself isn't that big of an interior and due to the long line of people you won't be able to stay in the store for long after you've received your order. 

The service was really good and they were nice in letting us try different flavors since there is so many  flavors to choose from and they all sound so good! From the flavors that I have gotten was the Thank You Very Matcha which was so good. My brother who doesn't even like matcha also enjoyed it. The Golden Oreo however was pretty sweet. A huge oreo ice cream fam but thought that this one was kinda sweet. I would definitely stop by again if I had a chance and the cookies just made it 100x better!",2
Lee Chen Asian Bistro,4,2018-06-27,"Wonderful Chinese restaurant serving Shanghai Cuisine! I thought this would be a tiny place with mediocre food, but it exceed expectations. The food was authentic and plentiful with great prices. From the moment I walked in, I was wowed by how beautifully decorated, clean and expansive the dining room was.

Service was very pleasant and quick. We came in half an hour before closing. I thought we would be turned away, but the staff was very polite about letting us know that they were closing soon but that they could still serve us. We were gently reminded about getting our order in, last call, and closing our bill without feeling rushed.

The food exceeded my expectations. We got xiaolongbao soup dumplings, pickled greens noodle soup, green onion pancake, and fried potstickers. Everything was delicious and very well priced. The portion sizes were generally good. The noodle soup was massive and a great size for sharing. The only size that seemed a little less than normal were the soup dumplings which came with only six, whereas I usually get ten in an order at other restaurants in the U.S.",2
La Chilaca Taqueria,5,2018-05-10,"Located at the back of the El Gordo complex in Kensington Market is a little hole in the wall you will not want to miss. La Chilaca Taqueria serves up authentic delicious Mexican cuisine at a price point that will knock your socks off!

I ended up trying their daily special (two Pastor Tacos for $5.00) and was thoroughly impressed. First of all, these things are huge (similar to the ones at Seven Lives). They have a crisp, grilled double layered corn tortilla which was absolutely delicious - soft, pliable and surprisingly light with just a hint of sweetness and a slight charred flavour. What really amazed me was that the tortilla held together even with all the filling inside it!

The inside of the tortilla is stuffed with a generous amount of delicious, tender marinated pork which was then topped with fresh onions, pineapple and cilantro. I loved how the sweet juicy pineapples added a vibrant summertime feel to the well-seasoned meat and the cilantro complimented everything with a light citrusy and peppery overtone. I squeezed on a splash of lime for a bit more of a sweet citrus kick. And then added on some of the red spicy sauce to enhance the flavours (although in retrospect, I should have probably gone with the green mild sauce instead). Definitely a taco you won't want to miss!",2
El Catrin Destileria,3,2020-01-14,"Guacamole was good but portions are not that big. The price of dishes are fine. Atmosphere was very nice. For the desert we had churros with chocolate and caramel sauce and they had really good taste and texture. We did waited some extra time for service and we shouldn't, because at that time restaurant wasn't to busy.. No free parking.",1
Como En Casa,5,2019-07-22,"Came here with my Spanish class of 7 after our last class. All 7 out of 7 of us polished our plates until it was shiny clean.

I ordered the tamales with mole chicken, with rice and beans. It came with a side of salsa, which I had refilled. BEST RICE AND BEANS I'VE EVER HAD!!! Want to cry just thinking about it. It was a revelation. And the tamales were very aromatic. The salsa was just the perfect kick to tie it all together.

Basically the best Mexican food I've ever had in Toronto.",2
Good Hombres,4,2020-01-17,"After hearing many phenomenal reviews about Good Hombres, and having tried its sister restaurant Campechano, I felt very much obligated and drawn to trying this place! To my knowledge, they've recently begun taking reservations, so I placed one for a Thursday night. It's quite a long, narrow joint - upon walking in, you're met with a kitchen counter / bar for takeout and quick orders. To get to the main dining room, you pass through a small doorway. The vibe is also significantly different from Campechano; it's a far more casual vibe adorned with bright, colourful paintings.

To be honest, I was on the fence between 3 and 4 stars. On the one hand, I really did enjoy the tacos and they're objectively better than most places. On the other, I enjoyed Campechano much more, but gave that place 4 stars. In terms of cost / value, both place ended up costing me roughly the same, but I found Campechano to be far more satisfying (they have a double tortilla and have heftier, more generous fillings).

We ordered 10 tacos (for $3.95) each. I got the pescado (fish / haddock), champinones (mushrooms), camaron (shrimp) for my first round. For my second, I got a second pescado and added the barbacoa (lamb leg). My boyfriend got the carnitas (confit pork shoulder), pastor (pork butt), and barbacoa. For his second round, he got double carnitas - he just loved it that much!

Carnitas & Barbacoa
These tacos tasted identical to the ones I had at Campechano, so my review remains unchanged. The carnitas, being cooked in its own fat, is a very rich and hearty concoction. There's no real acidity, apart from the lime, to balance out the flavours - as such, it's a very pure, meaty delight. The barbacoa is seasoned and has more spices, and the meat is less 'tender and soft' compared to the pork (though objectively still very tender).

Pastor
The pork butt is definitely tougher and drier than the other meats, but still super flavourful. I particularly liked the addition of the pineapples - while it threw me off initially, I found that the fruitiness helped balance the textures and flavours. 

Pescado
There was a good chunk of fried haddock on the taco, topped with some pickles and spicy chipotle mayo. It was delicious - and so lightly battered! The flavour is a bit more muted than the meat tacos, but so satisfying. 

Champinones
This was the weakest one, I found - but still super fragrant and umami. The mushrooms didn't go as well with the tacos as the other options, but it's still very flavourful and far better than the poblano peppers I had at Campechano last time.

Camaron
I personally found this taco a bit difficult to eat; the small pieces of deep fried, brown shrimp bits often crumbled and threaten to cascade on my plate. That said, the flavours were delicious! I found them somewhat similar to the pescado (likely attributed to the common denominator of chipotle mayo), but the flavours were far richer and heartier. Definitely my favourite - and this is a slightly 'pricier' (though nonetheless not expensive) taco at $4.25. Well worth it!

Overall, I did thoroughly enjoy Good Hombres. The tacos are smaller than those at Campechano (maybe ~60% of the size?) but the flavours are the same. The service and ambiance is good. It's likely a nature of the tacos I chose (fish and shrimp), but I found there to be too much chipotle mayo. That said, I would definitely come again, and cannot wait for the opening of their third store!",2
Bar Buca,3,2020-03-09,"I really wanted to like this place. The staff were friendly, and the food LOOKED good.

Alas - not to be.

We came here because my friend was craving their crespelle (olive oil fried pancakes). That was ok - it was a bit greasier than we thought it would be (and I say this as someone who loves olive oil cake) and was lacking in taste. The bombolone sandwich was delicious - the pun was the perfect texture complement to the sausage. And the tiramisu was also super disappointing - it was their ""take"" but was definitely not an improvement.

Damn.

I'd say this is more of a 3.5/5.",1
El Catrin Destileria,3,2020-02-01,"El Catrin is good! Located in the heart of Toronto's Distillery District, it prides itself on its traditional Mexican-style cuisine in a casual, yet oh-so-slightly-upscale atmosphere.

The interior is very tastefully decorated and the restaurant features a large outdoor patio equipped with giant space heaters for colder days.

I went to El Catrin for lunch and tried the Pepito torta while my companion had the Huevos Rancheros. The steak sandwich was really well marinated and super tender. Go for it! Oh, and we had the tableside-made guacamole with the tortilla chips (which turned out to be pretty excellent). You should go for that as well.

There aren't too many great options for food near Corktown/Distillery District, so give El Catrin a try next time you're around.",1
Terroni,3,2019-11-01,"Authentic italian food served in the same fashion.

Service: The staff were friendly, but the wait times were pretty unacceptable considering we had a large group with a reservation. We arrived on time, but still had to wait upwards of 30 minutes for a table, and it almost ruined the surprise birthday. The food came as ordered, but the waiters clearly didn't communicate with each other as they didn't know who ordered what and had to check several times.

Food: The pasta was cooked al dente, closer to the firmer side. You could tell the pasta was fresh, and they were fairly generous with the truffle shavings. However, the seasoning was a bit overwhelming, as it seemed to overpower the truffle flavour.

Overall: Seating was nice in a semi-private room, food was bene, but waiting half an hour for a reserved spot is not appreciated.",1
Asian Legend,3,2018-08-29,"Went there with my husband on a Saturday night, and noticed that they don't have many tables for 2-4 people. So you basically have to wait until a table is available. They do have seats on 2 levels. 
The Chinese food was average, nothing special. It's a little bit over priced compared to the other Chinese restaurants that's in the area.",1
Fudao noodle house,5,2019-05-04,"Place:
This place is so my favorite! I cannot stress how this is probably a top thing to do in Toronto. 

Service:
The service is pretty good. They are good at providing the necessary things needed for your entrees or what you ordered.

Food/price:
The food is known for their hotpot and ""DIY broths"". It is worth your buck because it is really fun making your own soup. There are some dishes where the noodles are all you can eat. SO WORTH

Audience:
A lot of my friends said that they really love going here when they travel to Toronto. Good for friends or dates! 

Recommend/tips?
I highly recommend this place and the tip would be come when it is not that busy! So not the typical lunch/dinner times.",2
Yummy Yummy Dumplings,1,2018-09-30,"I was craving soup dumplings and this restaurant has such good reviews that I just had to come here. It's a tiny restaurant down some steps, so it might be hard at first to find if you don't know what you're looking for exactly. There isn't a ton of seats, so if it's busy, you might need to wait for a table.

The restaurant itself could use a huge facelift. The washrooms were dirty and very small. The whole place just feels outdated - minus the tables and chairs. I came on a busy Saturday night but was seated fairly quickly. They cleaned my table before I was seated but the dish cloth they used to wipe the table was definitely used.. my table just smelled like a used dish cloth, sadly.
There were also a TON of mosquitos. We were seated right in front the of door, so perhaps this could be why.. but the most odd thing is that they would just drop onto our table and food, and almost die or stop moving instantly. Not sure what was going on.. but it ruined my appetite. 

ONTO THE FOOD: the most important reason why I'm reviewing! We ordered the Juicy Pork Dumplings (soup dumplings), fried shrimp & pork dumplings, & chive pancakes. The soup dumplings were just okay. The filling wasn't as flavourful as other ones that I've tried from other places. It was missing something but I can't figure out what it is. The pancakes were really good, and I wish I ate more but they were dripping I grease, so I couldn't eat more than 2. I didn't have any of the fried dumplings but my boyfriend said they were very greasy as well. We actually had to go get a drink from a bar close by just to get rid of the greasy feel in our mouths.

I honestly wouldn't come back here myself. A lot of other people gave this place high reviews so I'm not sure if I just had a bad experience or not. But the greasy food and mosquitos flying around or dropped dead in front of us wasn't acceptable.",0
Eataly,3,2020-03-11,"Eataly is located in the Manulife building but it has its own entrance (you have to walk past the Manulife building entrance) to see the Eataly one. If you go in the Manulife entrance, it's like a wild goose chase trying to find Eataly - there's no signage or direction anywhere. 

In general, Eataly is a nice concept for all things italian. The items are a little on the pricier side and you can get most items elsewhere for cheaper. But as my friend said, it's the Eataly experience.

There are a few restaurants (reservations recommended), counter type food stations, desserts, coffee, a bar, and a grocery store with meats, cheese, olives etc. 

I also think a lot of the produce products will end up in the garbage - you can see them starting to turn bad. Not sure if there is a large enough market for those products. 

Overall, it was a nice place to visit but the experience was just okay. It can get crowded with people everywhere just browsing. The food was just okay (we ate at La Pizza and La Pasta, and had a cannoli and a tiramisu after). I feel like I've had better Italian Food elsewhere. 

Come for the hype once and then spend your $$ elsewhere.",1
Lai Wah Heen,2,2019-06-08,"Stopped by on a Sunday for some dim sum, having visited previously ~6 years ago and recalling an enjoyable visit. Lai Wah Heen is on the second floor of an aging Doubletree Hotel in Chinatown. The hotel has seen better days, but the dining room is fine and clean, if dated. Our experience with the food on this visit was quite mediocre. While nothing was off putting, the flavor and quality were not a good as we had remembered, and certainly a far cry from our best dim sums in China/HK. Honestly, there were no clear highlights. Service was above average for a Chinese venue, i.e. you don't have to flag down a waitress, but nothing to write home about. While we are out-of-towners, believe there are probably better options for dim sum.",0
Campechano Taquería,3,2019-11-25,"After many friends had recommended this place, I decided to try it. Honestly, it was pretty overrated. The tortillas weren't great, and the guac was just alright. Glad I tried it because the place is cool, but the food is pretty forgettable.",1
Yummy Yummy Dumplings,4,2019-04-06,"We came on a Thursday night for dinner. The restaurant is quite small and it is on a basement level, we walked down stairs to get to the front entrance. There were a few tables occupied but many tables still empty so we didn't have to wait.

The restaurant has plain decor and they haven't done much in terms of upgrading furniture and renos, it's quite bare-bones. The menu has a wide selection of various dumplings, buns, and appetizers. To order you write down your menu item number on a piece of paper and give to the waiters. 

We ordered pork steamed dumplings, fried chicken dumplings, fried pork puns, and green onion pancakes. The dumplings were filled nicely with the meat and were quite large. For two people, we ordered more than enough and were very full. I loved the fried pork buns - they were juicy and fried just right at the bottom. I think the food is a little on the expensive side - it averages out to almost $1 per dumpling but for the quality and taste it's worth it. 

Overall a great little family owned shop in Chinatown to get your fill of dumplings. It's generous on the fillings of the dumpling and very flavourful. Yummy indeed!",2
Homemade Ramen,3,2019-03-15,"I guess I'm becoming more health-conscious, but after loading up on carbohydrates in the form of noodles, I didn't feel great afterwards. The noodles themselves are a step above your ordinary noodles, I have to admit. They do a good job in the noddles department, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that I ate something that wasn't beneficial for my health or my body. That place was packed on a Friday evening, so I'm guessing it's pretty popular and has a loyal clientele. Despite good service, I probably won't be coming back as my diet and food preferences are slowly shifting toward healthy & nutritious food that good for my body. Everyone has to make their own choice. After all, you are what you eat. Food is medicine if you eat the right food.",1
Buca,5,2019-08-16,"Dinner for 4 on Thursday - Summer.  We were able to get in but highly recommend you to make reservation.  Two hosts, very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.  We were seated in the comunal table (sits 8, but no one else joined). Great view to the kitchen.

Ambience is modern, dressy.  Great for special occasions.  You will feel you are in a restaurant in Italy.  Big open floor but somehow allows for intimate conversations.  Most people were enjoying one another and their food.

Prosciutto and selection of 3 cheeses were very tasty.  Prosciutto directly from Parma.  Best cheese of the 3 was Parmigiano (other two were Peccorino and Mozarella di Buffala).

For entrees:  Capeletti was our favorite dish- pasta filled w ricotta, lemon sauce and mushrooms.  Maccheroncini was a close second call- tomato sauce was so tasty and natural!.  Pomodoro e Tartufo pizza was done to perfection.  I noticed other reviews calling the weird shape of their pizzas.  Nothing weird about that.  Perfectly shaped and done Italian style.  Again, we felt we were in Italy.

Desserts: Torta Amalfi (almond based cake w fruit) was very tasty, recommend to share between 2 or 3.  Their gelatos were fluffy and flavorful.

Lastly, as expected, they had a very good selection of wines.  Their Italian list is very extensive.  We opted for a bottle of Nebbiolo and it paired very well w our dinner.",2
La Chingada,3,2020-03-02,"Went last week on Thursday to try their all you can eat Tacos. Nice hand made tortillas. I tried Beef, Carnitas, Pastor and Barbacoa. They were okish, the beef meat wasn't too good. Barbacoa was nice. Very well served with lots of meat. The salsas were in a bottle mild, medium and hot. Not very typical Mexican salsas in terms of flavour and freshness. A friend ordered a slice of Tres leches cake and something was off, the milk on it was not very good tbh so it wasn't eaten. So $19 for all you can eat, 3 tacos first and then one taco at the time. It wasn't completely bad but I doubt I will be back.",1
Wilbur Mexicana,3,2019-12-14,"Great spot if you wanna get some quick tacos or burritos.

There was a huge variety of options to order and al for a fair price however there was a huge lack of flavour in anything you ate until you added sauces from their sauce bar(which was great). I felt like I was getting grilled vegetables flavoured with salt and wrapped in a tortilla. 

My stars are really going towards the tomatillo sauce which really saved the day.",1

Taverna Mercatto,2,2019-12-19,"This is definitely Italian food for the after-work crowd, a Buca di Beppo-type of experience that didn't leave that much of an impression on my palate. It wasn't that the food was badly executed but rather that the plates were by-the-numbers unmemorable. I was here with the same dozen people I had been with for the previous eight hours, so small talk opportunities had already been exhausted as we sat closely together at a communal table. Because of the size of our party, I was able to try quite a number of their dishes and got a reasonably broad cross-section.

The common adjective connecting the plates was 'bland'. We started with the $14 Calamari Fritti which apparently came with shishito peppers that had disappeared by the time the plate was passed to me (photo: http://bit.ly/35MxgSg). Meh. I did manage to snag one of the overly chilled prawns on the $21 Shrimp Cocktail platter (photo: http://bit.ly/2EE5UBy). Better were the $13 Beets & Burrata with arugula and toasted almonds (photo: http://bit.ly/34Lnhva) and the $12 Greens which added celery hearts for crunch and a drizzle of sherry vinaigrette (photo: http://bit.ly/36TVmKG). The pasta plates were pretty standard issue given the couple of bites I was able to get of each.

The $21 Linguine di Mare was a typical seafood melange with little imagination (photo: http://bit.ly/2PGtJ22), while the $18 Tortiglioni alla Bolognese at least provided meatiness in the veal & pork ragu, but again it was bland and lacked freshness (photo: http://bit.ly/373WnjJ). The three different pizzas disappointed. The $18 Verdure had toppings and a basil pesto that were rather skimpy on the chewy crust (photo: http://bit.ly/38R3Y6R). while the $17 Margherita was just wet (photo: http://bit.ly/2Q1UXzi). Only the $19 Prosciutto was reasonably good with the padano cheese and prosciutto more plentiful (photo: http://bit.ly/34GULe2). 

Dessert came on cutting boards, and they offered a trio of which truthfully I only tried the Tiramisu Cake Roll which was OK (photo: http://bit.ly/2M8ukaH). There was also Chocolate Budino and Cannolo though my colleagues grabbed those pretty quickly (photo: http://bit.ly/36UM69j). My favorite part of the meal? The $14 Pimms Cup with ginger ale, lemon & cucumber, which honestly hit the spot far more than any of the food (photo: http://bit.ly/2SarzJH). Listen, none of us had high hopes for culinary delights here, and even our sponsor admitted this was not her first choice, but the proximity to our hotel just made it so convenient.

FOOD - 2.5 stars...standard issue Italian with few surprises
AMBIANCE - 2 stars...loud and rather packed after work
SERVICE - 2 stars...nothing special 
TOTAL - 2 stars...not worth seeking out unless your expense account covers it

RELATED - Traveling to Toronto? Here's a collection of places I've tried and reviewed: http://bit.ly/2LETSfV",0
Mexico Lindo,5,2020-02-23,"Ordered for the first time but I've heard so many great things about this place...
WOW
The portions are huge! Very hearty and fresh.
Everything stayed perfectly hot and ready.

The chicken was so tender and flavourful. 

I'll definitely have to get other things from the menu!",2
Mariachi’s Restaurant,3,2017-12-09,"It's pretty good Mexican food, and the atmosphere is cute. I sometimes come here for lunch when I am at work. Service is friendly and the food is decent. I've ordered the tacos, nachos and the churros. Can't go wrong.",1
Chop Chop,5,2020-05-13,"fried rice: it was really good and not too oily. It doesn't make you feel heavy at all. Not too salty and not too oily so you can keep eating without getting sick and tired of it.

Sweet and sour soup: the soup was good, since we ordered the noodle and rice, it was a good portion for the two of us

noodles: I don't quite remember how the noodles tasted sorry haha but I just remember everything being really good

servers are really nice :)",2
Lai Wah Heen,3,2019-06-02,"Lai Wah Heen used to be the best luxury dim sum restaurant in downtown Toronto. Overtime, the quality of the restaurant declined. While services and atmosphere still remain the same, quality and price are no longer on par. 

Out of the four items my brother and I shared, the best item was fried bean curd sheet with mushrooms served with aged balsamic vinegar ($5). It was crispy and juicy. Truffle Snow pea vegetarian wrap was unfortunately subpar ($5.5). The snow pea is not picked and over-steamed. 

With that said, it may still be a good option if you are a downtown dweller. However, I would not recommend Lai Wah Heen if you have access to dim sum restaurants in uptown Markham and Richmond Hill.",1
Fusaro’s Kitchen,2,2018-12-16,"The best thing about this place is the price of the food. Me and my wife went for dinner about an hour and a half before thier closing time on a Saturday night the place was less than half full. We were seated at a table that felt like it was a common walk way by the front door so requested if we could be moved and the waitress refused to move us saying she couldn't offer up a four person table to two people, even though there were plenty and the place wasn't even half full. 

On to the food: 
Bruschetta: bread used was good nice and toasted not overly hard. The tomatoes were tasteless and bland which ruins this dish no matter how good the bread is. Did not taste like bruschetta at all.

My wife ordered the rigatoni Bolognese with a rose sauce. She did not enjoy it at all saying it was watered down sauce with chunks of bland tomatoes. 

I had the penne ala vodka with meatballs as a sub for the bacon my dish was not bad  food came out piping hot, sauce was decent meatballs were small and tasteless.

If you're on a budget, don't care about good service or food quality then this is the spot for you!",0
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine,2,2019-11-17,"Tried the Dim Sum at dinner time- the quality leaves much to be desired although the food was hot and served with typical efficient minimalist ( they did top up your tea promptly) service. The Xiao long bao was completely dry; Char siew bao was dry and flakey ( below expectations). Pricey for the lack of quality.

Saw that they had Tiger beer which was a pleasant surpise 

We probably won't be coming back again .",0
Sichuan Garden Restaurant,3,2018-11-19,"I come to 川味轩 occasionally and every time think to myself ""oh no looks like they closed down"" because of the state of disrepair of the storefront. 

Once inside, it's the same familiar servers and that awful plaid carpet. The prices haven't changed much over the years and neither has the menu, although I did notice the portions are smaller. I always get the lunch specials Kung Pao chicken, a tofu dish and spicy cold noodles which never disappoints. Lunch specials come with a soup of the day. 

Tasty, good value and a viable option if you are willing to relax your standards of cleanliness.",1
King’s Tacos,4,2018-02-01,"After hearing rave reviews about this place from my brother, who loves food more than I do, we finally had a chance to feast on the delicious tacos from here. For 6 people we ordered a large guacamole, refried beans and 3 orders of the special build your own tacos (king's special, chorizo and beef with onion). 

When you arrive, they bring you unlimited nachos and their three sauces, mild, medium and spicy. The mild was my favourite! I can't really describe it but it has a nice smokey flavour and orange in colour. The medium is a green hot sauce which was equally delicious with a nice kick. The spicy was my least favourite. It was kind of spicy, but flavourless. 

The guacamole was delicious. It was perfectly mashed and not too chunky or too creamy. 

The refried beans were yummy, but really heavy so I didn't have too much of it. 

My favourite of the three meats we tried was the kings special. I loved the mix of all the flavours of beef, chorizo and bacon mixed with onions. Yummmm! The beef with onion and the chorizo were good, but for some reason, saltier than the kings special. Also, all these plates are extremely greasy, so keep that in mind because you won't be able to stop yourself from stuffing your face until you can't breath. It's just that delicious. The only downfall was that I felt really crappy for the next few days. The food here is really heavy and oily and it will be coming out of your pores. 

The service here is great! They're quick and friendly. This has been one of my favourite taco experiences in Toronto thus far!",2
Carisma,4,2019-08-07,Great spot for really good Italian. My wife loved it here for her birthday. Food was great and service top notch. Worth a try.,2
Grazie Ristorante,3,2019-03-09,"We came to Grazie for dinner on a Friday evening. It was half empty when we came in (around 4:45), but it was packed by 6pm. Honestly, I expected food to be better based on all the reviews, however it wasn't spectacular food! Service was fine (when it wasn't busy), ambience was traditional but very noisy (perhaps because restaurant is small and packed with people). 

I don't know if I'll return to try again as would like to explore other restaurants around.",1
Miku,2,2019-12-10,"I wanted sooo badly to love Miku ...Because of the high ratings and I being a major sushi lover, I had very high expectations for this place. My overall experience was extremely underwhelming and disappointing.. The quality of the food is definitely not worth the price.

We ordered the anniversary prix fixe, signature sushi selection platter, beef carpaccio and tuna tartare. The prix fixe was OK.. quantity wise this one is actually worth the price as you get a lot of courses, but only the sashimi stood out as it was delicious and so fresh that it melted in my mouth! The sashimi is my favourite dish out of the ENTIRE meal... none of our other dishes stood out at all.. they did not taste fresh and to be honest, very bland. The beef carpaccio had barely any sauce on it but for some reason, had such a strong and weird after taste that my partner only managed 2 bites LOL. I've dined at many sushi restaurants and have had way better quality and fresh sushi for less than half the price at Miku..

Service was pretty good. Our server was very sweet, made sure our waters were always filled and checked up on us a few times. It was just a bit hard to understand her when she was explaining the food items due to her accent but its not too big of a deal.. 

I don't recommend and don't plan to return to Miku... so much better sushi out there at a far better price.",0
Baretto Caffe,5,2018-09-11,"For a few years I've heard about this place, drove by this place, promised myself I'd stop by one day....and it finally happened!  It's an unassuming little cafe - tucked inside a medical building so it might be easy to miss - there is a sign out front indicating the cafe is in the plaza.

I checked in on Yelp and luckily check in offer is a free cap/latte/tea - yeah!   I also ordered a slice of the veggie pizza b/c I was a little hungry.  They do have a pretty good food menu - from breakfast items, to pizzas to pastas.  

Seating is in the front - a few tables and off to the side in a little room - which is so nice - fireplace, clean tables, nice art.  

The veggie pizza (the menu says they use whatever seasonal veggies they have on hand) was pretty good - medium crust, nice and crispy crust and you could see the veggies - mushrooms, peppers.  Not like some veggie pizzas where everything is diced up so fine you can't see anything.  It came with a little side salad.

I ordered the latte and it was nice - smooth and flavourful and they do latte art here!  I got the teddy bear :)  

I could hear the owners/staff greeting a lot of customers - so I assume quite a few people are regulars (assuming they are coming in to the medical offices first).  

I'll definitely be back!",2
Mariachi’s Restaurant,1,2017-05-12,"Almost gave it two stars (read to find out more) but the one thing I can't get over is serving an alcoholic drink to someone who specified ""virgin"", when you delivered it to the table she checked again that it was ""virgin"", you agree verbally it had no alcohol, she tries some, tastes alcohol and then you go -- ""Oooh actually this one is the virgin"".  Sure, if she was pregnant or on medication or driving, maybe the sip of alcohol wouldn't be *that* big a deal.  But if she was recovering alcoholic, that one sip could literally change her life, and it's up to you as a business to be honest and knowledgeable about what you're serving.

Things that were terrible:
- we had a reservation, they called us to confirm it was for 700 pm, show up, they say oops we thought 730 pm, they literally have to move people from their seats to accommodate us
- during the 45 minute wait for all this to take place, they took drink orders from us multiple times, but never served us drinks
- they dropped an entire plate of steaming hot chicken fajitas on the ground, it splashed boiling sauce all over people, and their clothes as well
- when i went over to the owner at this point to say - now that we are covered in fajita sauce - can we please have the drinks we keep trying to order? she made a HUGE stink about it, just immediately responded, ""We didn't do any of this on purpose, do you understand? We are doing our best"" and then going to every member of my party reiterating that, as though I had done some rude injustice to her, it was super embarrassing and unprofessional
- drinks still took an extra hour and they weren't good
- they served the birthday girl fajitas with no tortillas or sides, just the meat (she didn't ask for that modification)
- the food was so awful my poor fiance actually sent his BACK -- and this is a guy who complains about NOTHING
- bills took over an hour after asking MULTIPLE times
- the place was so warm they had to keep opening the front door to let in cool air

It almost got 2 stars because they did pay the dry cleaning bill for the jacket that was covered in fajitas sauce, but honestly, I can't forgive the alcohol incident.  This whole experience was stressful and awful. I have no idea why they took our reservation (none of us had been there before), we were clearly too big a group for them at 700 (or 730..or 800...depends who you ask) on a Saturday!",0
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine,1,2019-02-21,"Came here to celebrate my Friends Birthday, Food is good but for the price its not worth it.service not good. I ask them if they can do something for her like candle and small dessert..And she said yeah we can do that..And I was waiting for it and she forgot and I felt bad that I have to said it infront of my friend when it supposed to be surprise.He said that they don't have anything like that but We saw that they did it on the other table.By the way we paid around $500 for that small portion of food and Bad service!",0
KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL,3,2020-03-12,"One of the oldest restaurants that I had been to. Since North York. It's always been a great experience with them! No matter was the lunch hours having great lunch sets and yummy fish; but also the dinner are always pretty impressive. The late snacks are pretty good too! 
Don't forget to try their cocktails if you drink! 
Overall a pretty good experience there although sometimes is too noisy to talk with frds",1
Ristorante Sotto Sotto,5,2019-12-29,"As an Italian chef myself, there aren't many restaurants where I would dine unless it's my own or Sotto Sotto. 
Hands down one of The Best Italian Restaurant in Ontario.",2
Lee Chen Asian Bistro,4,2019-08-07,"Lee Chen Asian Bistro is a decent spot for Chinese food near the theatres and financial district. It may look small from the outside, but it's quite large and spacious in the inside. The interior is very clean with nice decor. It even has a small garden and mini running waterfall just outside of the restaurant (great if you can score a table by the window, facing the mini garden). The customer service is very attentive and superior for a Chinese restaurant (e.g. the servers come by your desk to ask if everything is ok a few times throughout the meal, which usually doesn't happen in most other Chinese restaurants).

The menu contains some typical Chinese dishes. During weekday lunch hours, they have a separate lunch ""combo"" specials which are pretty good. Each combo comes with a choice of carbs (white rice, brown rice, fried rice, or fried noodles), meal entrée (protein / veg choices), bowl of side salad, and a spring roll. I ordered the brown rice and it came in a cute bamboo container. The entrée was nicely presented on an edible open flower-shaped bowl made out of crispy wonton skin.

The restaurant is a great choice for having a business or team lunch. The large space can accommodate large parties if booked in advance. The ambience is also nice and not too loud.",2
Eataly,1,2020-02-21,"OK
in life we are allowed to change our minds.
This place is so CONGESTED and FRUSTRATING.
You had to know it would be a success!???  Rent the whole building out!?  A claustrophobic maze getting in and out of here..  want a coffee/espresso upstairs; FORGET about it; I've been 8 times; only twice was the line under a dozen people, it's good but the line is too long.  Some of the worst cashiers at pizza line; chatting, hugging, orders wrong... I don't think I like this place anymore.",0
Lee Chen Asian Bistro,3,2019-06-18,"My friend and I were in the area, craving Chinese food, and didn't want to walk too far, so we came here for dinner on a Saturday night. The restaurant is nice on the inside and well kept. The waitstaff are friendly enough and pretty attentive. The food is pretty overpriced though and lacks flavor.

My friend ordered the green onion pancake and wonton soup. I had the spicy beef noodle soup. The green onion pancake was average, but the wonton soup broth had pretty good flavor. There were only three small wontons though, which my friend wasn't happy about. I wish the beef noodle soup had some flavor - it tasted like spicy and mildly salty water, which was surprising given how rich the soup looked. The noodles had a nice springy-ness to them, and there was A LOT of beef. I usually complain there isn't enough beef in my noodle soups, but I couldn't finish all the beef in my soup this time!

I'd consider taking friends here if they've only grown up on burgers their whole life and want to try Asian cuisine (maybe bring some spice packets along...), but I would not recommend this place to people who want authentic Chinese food. Take a 25 minute walk to Spadina Avenue instead.",1
MEXITACO,5,2019-02-15,"Yum, what else u wanna know.

Good authentic food,  fresh, delicious,  good flavor and good beers too!
 Try it",2
Chula Taberna Mexicana,2,2018-12-23,"I came last summer and had an amazing dinner, I remembered the tacos to be rich in flavour and super affordable which was a big stand out to me since a lot of other taco places that charge upwards of $7/8 per taco. I dare to say that this WAS my favourite taco place at the time.

I came back this month for the first time in nearly a year and things were a lot different. For Tacos, I ordered the Biztec de Carne and the Carnita and they ended up tasting exactly the same, which was disappointing and weird since they have a lot of different ingredients altogether. Also there seemed to be a lot of liquid in the taco filling because halfway through eating one of my tacos it fell apart due to the moisture. Also, in all of the tacos, there seemed to be this weird crunchy/salty/sweet ingredient that I couldn't tell what it was. It was really odd, and gave the tacos a weird flavour/texture profile. This was not the same as what I ate a year ago, and they seemed to be more expensive than I remembered.

The one thing that stayed consistent however was their amazing Churro Sundae - everyone in the restaurant seemed to be ordering this. Their Churros were seasoned and cooked perfectly, and the caramel ice cream pairs perfectly - its one of the best churro desserts in the city in my opinion, and would come back just for this.",0
Los Guaca-Moles,1,2018-09-23,"If you want to pay for a virgin margarita for a regular priced margarita, by all means come to this place!",0
Cinco Mexican Restaurant,4,2019-02-27,"My husband and I were in the area and thanks to Yelp, we ended up at this cute restaurant. Our visit here definitely didn't disappoint! Upon walking in, the beautiful murals are hard to miss and it's noticeably small with only a few tables but I actually like that about it. There's something great about hole in the wall type places as these very places are often where great food is at and you'll find that's the case here for sure. 

There were so many choices - each of the different tacos sounded delicious! There are street tacos which are smaller in size for about $4 each and there are a few options like chicken, pork, beef, fish, and vegetarian. There are also gourmet tacos which are more of the stars of the menu here since they are bigger in size and there are many more options that the street tacos. Check out the menu as there are too many to name! The gourmet tacos range in price from around $7.99 - $9.00 depending on which one you order. There's something for everyone!

We ended up getting the combined chorizo and beef gourmet taco, as well as the braised pork and pork belly gourmet taco. Both were filling and delicious but the chorizo/beef taco was slightly more flavourful. Complimentary nachos are provided while you wait for your order as well. I also loved how this place has a salsa bar of about six different salsas with different levels of heat. We enjoyed each one but I particularly liked the creamy habanero one. This place is definitely worth a visit!",2
El Trompo Taco Bar,3,2019-07-09,Their margaritas are excellent but their tacos aren't as good as they used to be. They are very simple - which isn't a bad thing *if* the few ingredients used standout and are prepared well. The pork was dry and the overall taco was flat - it didn't have the bright acidic flavours or freshness that I love in a taco.  The fish was tender but the chipotle sauce was overwhelming and I couldn't taste much beyond that. The queso fundido with mushrooms and onions was delicious and flavourful - it reminded me of French Onion soup. This place used to have delicious tacos years ago- hopefully I feel the same way about it soon.,1
Terroni,3,2020-01-27,"For so many years, I have never visit Terroni.  Actually after dinner tonight I don't think there's an urgent need as everything was normal and on the pricey side.

Was looking at the mushroom pasta special for Monday and the cost was  31.  I asked the waiter what's the portion sIze and he told me 5 pieces.....really?!

OK I went with the grilled calamari for $18 and a side of rapini for $10 instead.  Well, the calamari was alright, I like the tomato arugula salad a lot underneath but the rapini wasn't good as it was super hard to chew.

My friends had the $170 steak combo which came with a salad and a plate of veggies and it tasted good.

So my verdict is 2.5 stars  round up to 3 here we don't have half star option for review.  Prob won't be back tbh.",1
Miku,3,2020-02-19,"Winterlicious Dinner Review $53

Finally got to try Miku for their winterlicious dinner menu. For $53 you got an appetizer, a main and a dessert option.

Appetizer:
Sushi Sampler - included some pressed sushi's (shrimp and salmon), two nigiris (shrimp and sea bream), and two pieces of rolls (spicy red tuna and a white tuna one). The sample was decent tasting. My favourites were the two nigiri pieces as they were very fresh and flavorful. The pressed sushi ones were okay as well and provided a more 'fusion' type sushi taste. My least favourite was the rolls. They tasted dry and bland to the point that it was hard to tell what you were sampling. 

Main / Entree: 
Sablefish and Lobster Ravioli with eggplant, mushrooms and romanesco. 

I really enjoyed this entree. I though the sablefish was marinated and cooked perfectly. It was a perfect balance of sweetness and melt in your mouth smoothness. The lobster ravioli and cream sauce was amazing as well. You could really see and taste the quality ingredients that went into the ravioli with lobster meat on every bite. The accompanying vegetables were a little disappointing and very bland tasting. I felt like the romanesco and mushrooms were just blanched with hot water with no seasoning. It didn't really add to the dish, if anything took away from the other two tasty items. 

Dessert: 
Green Tea Opera Cake with Green Tea Gelato

The dessert tasted standard. I heard a lot of great things about this cake and was super excited to try it, but perhaps it was overhyped. I felt the cake part (chocolate ganache) overpowered the green tea flavour as opposed to complimenting it. But, the gelato was very delicious and pungent, which I enjoyed.

The service was great as usual. My only complaint was the fact that the women's bathroom always seems to be in disarray. I think more attention needs to be paid to it for this type of restaurant that thrives in the 'experience'. One stall was broken and there was toilet paper everywhere on the floor. 

Overall, I felt that the food was decent, but perhaps the quality is not as high when it is Winterlicious? Mop",1
Buca Yorkville,3,2019-08-24,"Debated long and hard on what rating to give; ultimately decided on a 3.5, but rounded downwards to a 3! Although I had a great time there with  colleagues, it was really due to the company. The food was decent (neither spectacular nor amazing), but the service was, for the most part, non-existent. It took so long to flag someone down!

We had reserved a table for 10 at 6:30PM, and were seated in a private area, slightly hidden from the rest of the restaurant. To start, we ordered a selection of three salumi di mare. Don't be fooled! While many things here at Buca Yorkville are seafood-related, the salumi does contain some pork options. With the server's recommendation, we got the Soppressata di Polipo (octopus salami which therefore includes pork), Opah (cured moonfish), and I believe the Salmone Affumicato (smoked salmon). Accompanying this spread were gnocco fritto, fried squid ink dumplngs made with pork fat, and two small pieces of pickled onion. The smoked fish was the best and absolutely stole the show! It had a very rich and smoky flavour, and the saltiness whet my appetite. However, the other salumi were just okay.

A must order at Buca is the nodini - these small garlicky bread knots that are little bites of heaven! As my manager says, these are the ""yesdini"". We got two orders for the table, but as the knots disappeared in record time, we ordered another two portions. These nodini really stole the show!

We then ordered our own mains; I got the Polipo e Vongole. A small whole octopus came placed on top of some clams and crispy artichokes, with these al dente small pasta balls (the fregola sarda, which resembles couscous) soaking up the delicious broth. However, the octopus truly fell flat. It was soft, but lacked all flavour - it was bland, unseasoned, and just didn't stand out. For a main that costs $50, I was expecting something a bit more. My colleague ordered the risotto, and was very disappointed as well. It came in an extremely small and shallow bowl / plate, and he devoured it all in the matter of minutes. 

For dessert, we ordered two pairs of three desserts (from the four on the menu) to share:
Tiramisu - This dish barely resembled a tiramisu, and was more along the lines of a deconstructed dessert with a dark chocolate shell and mascarpone cream. It was interesting, but not what we were craving for and wanted.
Pizelle - This dessert stole the show, and was the best! The peach preserve and whipped cream made it appear deceivingly light (although you're well aware it's not, given all the dairy and richness). The presentation was also lovely; when the server poured the ganache over the top, the dessert was just imploring me to take photos!
Torta - I forgot the full name, but this chocolate hazelnut tart served with olive oil and squid ink just completely missed the mark. The olive oil imparted some savouriness to the dish, but the squid ink took it to a whole other level by adding some fishy essence. We left this largely untouched.

The wine assortment here is good, but also pricey (we paid ~$250 for a bottle of red, I believe). If I were to go to Buca again, I'd likely go to the King location for more of the earthy and meaty pasta choices. While this location was decent, it simply didn't meet expectations.",1
Enoteca Sociale,2,2019-07-27,I came here and had a short male server with a buzz cut and glasses that was very rude.,0
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3,2020-03-16,"I'm really not sure why this place has such great reviews, I found the food merely average. The interior reminds me more of the Southeast Asia budget ""backpacker"" vibe, ie partiers. It's certainly a part of the Thai experience but not really my thing.

Tom yum soup - this was pretty solid with vibrant flavors and a good kick. Maybe I've really lost spice tolerance but I was starting to drip before I was done with the cup...

Pad cha hett - mushroom stir fry. I got this with black rice just to try something new and it didn't quite fit the rest of the dish. If you get this, stick with the jasmine. The stir fry part was disappointingly bland though. It had a bit of a fennel taste to it, not sure what that comes from.",1
Levetto,2,2018-11-22,"Overrated non-authentic Italian food. Their location gives them business. 

Menu is interesting but not up to standard. Ambience is okay.",0
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,4,2019-12-28,"This place is definitely one of my favourite Thai restaurants in Toronto! The flavours are very authentic and I am still craving this now as I write this. Reservations are preferred, especially for a large group as this restaurant is extremely popular and crowded. The decor is very welcoming and unique, with vintage items on the walls and tables. I would recommend dining in the separate area in the back, as it is quite loud and may be too noisy for some. 

My favourite dishes are the pad gra prow (Basil Stir-Fry Beef with steamed jasmine rice) and the green curry that comes inside a coconut, which is a nice touch. I don't normally have a high spice tolerance, but the medium spice level was just right for me or it would be too bland otherwise. I also loved their Thai Iced Tea which was very rich and refreshing! Look forward to my next visit!",2
Artisan Plus,1,2019-10-07,"The food here was mediocre but the service was absolutely abysmal, to the point where I'm not even considering the food in the rating I'm giving. 

The server was extremely rude - I asked for an iced tea (canned drink) upon being seated after a 20 minute wait and the server legit said ""just order your drink when you order everything else"" and walked away, even though it was simply a canned drink that takes 1 minute to take out of the fridge. 

When it came time to order our meal, I asked for the drink again, which the server acknowledged. I didn't receive the drink during my whole meal and no one came to check on us so I wasn't able to reorder. 

When the bill came, they actually had the audacity to charge us for the drink that I never received, and when we asked them to take it off the bill they didn't come back with the bill for over 15 minutes, and didn't print a receipt for us because their ""machine was broken"". 

Honestly I'm not sure if we were charged for it, but a place that would allow their servers to talk to/treat customers like this is definitely not a place that I would recommend to others because it says a lot about the restaurant's values and culture, and the food is definitely not special enough to put up with this kind of service.",0
Donatello Restaurant,2,2018-08-23,"Recommended:
Veal marsala with penne

Ok:
Shrimp and scallops in wine sauce

Meh:
Roasted bell peppers. They're ok, but the quantity makes no sense unless you have a group to share with.

This type of food is really not my thing. A bit too straight forward and bland.

The food is simple Italian, but not special. The veal was well seasoned but a bit chewy. Still it was better than the shrimp and scallops dish, which contained small scallops and shrimp which seemed overcooked or reheated.

Olive oil and vinegar bottles are covered with corks which are very greasy. I have no idea how these could possibly be clean. Your fingers get dirty at minimum.

For the price, I expect higher quality or at least more interesting food.

Service was a bit absent at times, but passable overall. They only have one credit card machine, which created a bottleneck of a few minutes. It didn't matter this night, but if you have a time constraint, it is not a fast meal. The waiter explained and apologized, at least.",0
Playa Cabana,3,2019-08-04,"Went here with my friends and family. I liked the spice side fillings and their lobster tacos was good I heard. I had the veggie enchiladas and was alright. Even the veggie tostadas was good. However, I feel the food was expensive for the food quality.
We got the 
Nachos  - small but good
Guacamole and chips - good needed some spice 
Chicken wings - so so 
Veggie enchiladas - was so so 
Veggie burrito - good 
Veggie tostados - good
Shrimp enchiladas - was so so 
Lobster tacos - very good 
Fish tacos - very good 
Pork tacos - was so so",1
KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL,3,2019-11-04,"Heard a lot of hype about Kinka from friends who've been here previously and I wanted to love it but the volume level and food ultimately is what makes me give this place 3 stars. 

It's ABSURDLY loud, can't hear the person next to you talking; get ready to scream your order out. Most of the food was fine to not good but some of the things that I did find pretty delicious was the buta kakuni, miso black cod (albeit way too bones), and the yaki udon.

The karrage had too much batter and was hella dry, salmon oshizushi was bland, takoyaki and okonomiyaki was really w/e.

Basically I've had the same dishes better and at a reasonable volume at other places. Kinka is ultimately a turn up spot and if you treat it as such you won't be disappointed.",1
Trattoria Nervosa,2,2019-10-20,"We came here today to have her usual Sunday family dinner. However, we found her self with a very poor service, unfriendly waiter, cold food and very plain flavors. The place is very cozy, Nevertheless I would not recommend this place.",0
Como En Casa,2,2019-07-05,"Based on the ratings and reviews I was very excited to check this place out. I ordered a ""large chicken burrito"" which cost 14$. I got a really authentic vibe when I walked in. However, the burrito was one of the cheapest ones I've ever eaten. I asked for guacamole.... no guacamole. It was majority lettuce, rice, and bread from the overlapped wrap. Had to search just to find any chicken, very minimal. It was very dry, barely any sauce. Cheese was not good quality. All flavours were very bland. Extremely disappointing, for $14 I expect at minimum good size/quantity but didn't even get that.",0
El Nahual Tacos,3,2019-11-13,"I got the 6inch shrimp burrito -- definitely not the best burrito I've ever had but it wasn't bad either. I enjoyed it but was disappointed when they said they didn't have any hot sauce?!! You also can't choose toppings either, I'm pretty sure all the burritos comes with the same thing (rice + peppers and onions) Again, tasted good didn't mind that at all but I think my extreme hunger made it taste a lot better, if that makes any sense. I probably won't be back but glad I got to try this place out!!! Maybe if I had tried the tacos my opinion would be different but you can def find better taco places I'm sure",1
Ristorante Sotto Sotto,2,2019-12-29,"Came here on a Sunday evening with 4 people. The seafood risotto was good with lots of seafood. 

The surprising part was that the server/restaurant added automatically added a 20% tip to the bill. He just put in the tip amount himself on the POS terminal and said service charge was added. 

I do not like being forced into tipping at a certain amount and therefore would not visit the restaurant again.",0
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,3,2020-04-20,"This place is a small hole in the wall and worth visiting if you crave some good old fashioned tacos rather than the commercial stuff.. portion sizes were good however the flavours were slightly missing for me.. 

I would visit them again if I was in the area, but not necessarily my go to place. Please don't let my review deter you from trying their tacos though, they are still pretty good. 

Flavours can be very subjective and this place is definitely worth a try.. but if you know and love tacos and taco culture as much as me, then you would also know that everyone has their own go to spot.. 

This place has great service, friendly staff and a small seating area if you just want to eat quickly or grab'n'go.",1
Quetzal,4,2019-12-17,"So long story short I love it! Like really really really great experience. 
The food is obvs amazing. I love how their menu is set up, and the selection is fantastic. Their twist on some of the traditional Mexcian dishes is very superb. Service was impeccable. Our server was extremely knowledgeable fo all the menu items and food preparation. 
Cocktails are amazing as well. 100% Taste was great. Although a bit too pricy. The wine is overpriced too, which I guess it's typical for this type of restaurant. But that's where you lost the fifth star - overpriced alcohol.",2
Trattoria Taverniti,1,2018-11-21,"I was in shock with food here...the food was extremely disappointing. For prices that are on par with most mid-range Italian restaurant, the food was horrible.
 
I came here with reservations and we were seated immediately. It was during dinner hours but they only had one staff serving all the tables. With just one server, the service was really slow from bringing us the menus and taking down our orders. 
 
Service:
 
The service was slow since they don't have many staff. 
 
Food:
 
My friend and I ordered two appetizers and two entrees to share. Out of the four items we ordered, only one of the item was decent with the rest being disappointing. 
 
N'duja bruschetta - We were deciding to order a bruschetta and opted for this one because it was different. The menu described this to be a bruschetta with a spicy pork sausage spread drizzled with honey. Although I was aware that this was going to be just a spread on bread, it looked disappointing when it arrived to the table because the spread was so thin. I was expecting something thicker to give it more flavor.  I also looked at other tables bruschetta and it looked very average.
 
Calamari Fritti - Another disappointing appetizer. When this arrived, I was a bit shocked because it didn't even look like there was batter... When my friend and I tried it, we both agreed that there wasn't enough crisp. The dish didn't look appetizing either.  
 
Gnocchi Gorgonzola - I wanted to try the gnocchi since the menu states they are handmade. The pasta came out and I thought the color was unappealing; it was like a greenish/greyish color. I guess it is because this sauce is a nutty creamy sauce. The texture of the gnocchi was chewy and nice. However, I wasn't a fan of the sauce.
 
Tagliatelle al Funghi Misti - This was AWFUL Some of the noodles were stuck together and this is the first time I've experienced this at a restaurant. The menu does mention this is a lighter sauce, and I thought it was a lighter flavor....but I didn't expect it to be less saucy.  There was BARELY any sauce actually.  The sauce was pretty much nonexistent and I felt like eating noodles in water. This pasta had no taste. It was $18 and it was literally just plain noodles without much sauce and flavor; the pasta was very dry. 
 
Overall:
 
I would never return. With most of their pastas ranging from $17-20, I was expecting similar quality to other restaurants in this price range. The tagliatelle was so dry and awful. The bruschetta also barely had any toppings on it.",0

Wilbur Mexicana,4,2020-03-07,"I visited this place on a weekday evening. They don't have any table reservations and it's the first come basis. You place your order on the counter and then go and find yourself a table. The food is delivered at the table. There is a common area where water & cutlery is available for self service.

The place stands out from the other Mexican places because of their Salsa counter. They have 7 different kinds of Salsas which are free with your meal. Try some of the spicy salsas at your own risk. Their Ghost Salsa is extremely spicy. Now, let's talk about food. I tried their Veggie Burrito, Mushroom Tacos & Grilled Avocado Taco. The portion sizes were good and value for money. They serve complimentary tortilla chips with every entree. Burritos had a quinoa filling but you can upgrade to rice for 1 dollar. Tacos were really good with a nice blend of sauces. For my taste buds, burrito felt a little dry though. Overall, a nice place to try some Mexican options.",2
Eataly,3,2020-04-04,"Eating at Eataly is a mission and a half. 
Starting with the half mission, parking. Looking for public parking or street parking was a disaster. Found out after, I could have parked at the Manulife centre and received a 2 hour parking voucher if $50 was spent at Eataly, located upstairs, which was validated by reception, located on the main level. Yes, that's the process. Wild. 

That was the half mission - on to the full mission. In addition to navigating to find Eataly from the streets, you'll have to navigate to the Manulife Centre then up to the second floor. Here, you'll have to navigate through hoards of people, waiting in line or casually roaming around. Once you've done a full walk and decided where to eat, it's another 1-2 hour wait for a table at your desired restaurant. Tip. Do it the reverse way. Go to the restaurant and make your reservation THEN roam around. 

Finally, on to the food review. 
I chose La Piazza. Three items. 

Mozzarella ball. This was 4/5. It was soft and fresh as expected. Sprinkled with olive oil and salt. 

Mushroom pizza. 2/5. Basic pizza. I know. While consuming, I had a feeling I've had better at a mom and pop local pizza shop.

Penne. 3/5. Average. Nothing special to say. It was al dente - which was advertise. 

Verdict. Would I return? No. So much hype for no reason. Crowded beyond belief. 

However, if you made it this far, please try the cannoli - it made the trip worth it. They offered classic cow milk. They do offer the traditional sheep milk, it's definitely an acquired taste. These were 5/5.

I also forgot to mention. Eataly does offer fresh pasta and the freshest vegetables I have ever seen.",1
Agio,4,2019-10-06,"My friend and I almost walked right out after arriving at Agio and finding ourselves the only 2 people there for at least 10 minutes. There were plenty of good reviews on Yelp so we decided to give it a chance. Things started to look up after the chef/owner finally came out of the kitchen. The restaurants decor is quirky and if you dont care about aesthetics, I think you will enjoy this restaurant. The Korean man knows his Italian food. His entertaining stories are a bonus.",2
Taverna Mercatto,2,2019-09-05,"Came here for a late lunch with my boyfriend. Love the ambience and the decor of this place. Unfortunately, this was the highlight of the entire meal. Service was very lack-lustre, perhaps we caught them at a time when they were recovering from the lunch rush. A bit disappointing considering there were only a couple of tables and you'd think service would then be on point.

We shared the frutti di mare, some olives, and the chitarra carbonara, and a couple of glasses of wine. The frutti di mare was quite fresh, but the portion was quite small considering the price point. The olives were pretty delicious and was a great little appy. Unfortunately, the carbonara, which looked amazing was flavourless, dry, and lacked any seasoning. The egg itself was fantastic but barely provided any flavour or added any creaminess to the pasta.

I was really looking forward to finding a staple Italian restaurant nearby, but with all the other Italian restaurants in the area, I can't really think of any reason, why we'd come back to Taverna Mercatto.",0
La Chingada,3,2019-05-21,"I think this is between a 3 and a 4.  I enjoyed the tacos,   the chicken one was really very tasty.  But what a mess to eat,  the wrap was very soft and fell apart but it all had a wonderful taste,   lots of flavours.

I had the melted cheese starter with chorizo,  it was ok.  I personally don't like the corn wrap they make here.   They are thick and heavy and really doesn't add anything to the cheese dip.    We had the chips and dip to start with.   There was were some very nice dips here from chillies and guacamole too.   The chips are quite salty though, be warned.   We also had a tasty citrus drink,  grapefruit based,  this was very nice,  we both enjoyed this.   We ended with the churros which were very nice.  Sweet cinammon sugar on top,   very yummy. 

On the whole it was good and alright mixed together.   But also isn't cheap.   I think it cost us $70 for food and two sodas,",1
Artisan Plus,3,2019-07-28,"Relatively new noodle spot that opened up downtown just at Bay and Dundas. Came by with a few coworkers for lunch and the consensus was that it was okay. 

Even though Artisan plus was packed when we arrived. We were lucky and was able to get seated fairly quickly for a party of 6. 

We were seated on the high top right in front of the kitchen and got to witness the staff in action. It still amazes me how efficient the kitchen works, it's a well oiled machine. 

I ordered the appetizer trio, pork bun, and clam mashi. The appetizer trio was a combo of enoki, bean curd, and tripe. Of the 3 the tripe stood out the most. The bean curd and enoki mushroom were okay at best. The trio comes with dipping sauce that tasted very similar to a peanut sauce. 

The pork bun was shared among the group and we found that although the pork was really flavourful and moist, the bun itself was a tad on the dry side. Not the good kind either. It's worth a try but I wouldn't be ordering this again if I visited again. 

The clam mashi was amazing! I've gotta say I could have done with without the other two items on the menu but the clam mashi is a must. Be warned, it's a little spicy. I would say out of 10, would be about a 7 on my scale. Not to the point where the heat was unbearable and unenjoyable. It definitely lingers and I found myself going through water pretty quickly. The clams were declines in the dish and there was quite a few in there to enjoy. This was my first time having mashi and I'm now a big fan of that.",1
Playa Cabana,3,2019-08-24,"Surprisingly good Flautas! They came as 3 rolls made of a crunchy tortilla containing lots of shredded juicy beef (although I thought it tasted more like pork haha). It all sat in a pool of thick savoury sauce that wasn't overly salty. I also tried their White Wine Sangria, $60 for a pitcher was OK for this citrusy drink with a decent amount of alcohol! 

TIP: if you're celebrating a birthday, let the staff know and they'll surprise the bday person with a hat, song & free slice of a DELICIOUS dulce Leche soaked cake !

Otherwise, the indoor seating space is really tight and the service was subpar.",1
Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse,5,2020-02-15,"Great food and amazing service. Loved every bit of it.

Worth every penny!",2
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria,1,2020-02-09,"Not even going to talk about the food here because the service here was abysmal. We asked for 3 cups of hot water and were charged $1.50/cup. When we asked the waiter why they charge for hot water they mentioned that all restaurants in yorkville charge for water. After suggesting some of the restaurants  we regularly visit that offer complimentary hot water, the waitress said, ""I guess those restaurants aren't high end anyway...""

I'm sorry, kasa moto and one have $$$ and $$$$ ratings while this barn has $$. Snobs.",0
Asian Legend,1,2018-06-02,"Food was ok nothing special. 
The taste was more blend i don't know i thought after reading the reviews it will be a good place but I didn't like the food flavors. 
We ordered a lot of food.
After waiting so long that someone's gonna pick up our order.
To this counts noodle with beef, crispy fried noodles, veggies and dumplings and beef pancake.
Actually I liked the beef pancake and the dumplings.
When we were finished we ordered the bill. 
A lady came with the takeout boxes and then the drama starts I don't know the lady was packing the food and she throws angry the empty plate on the table. 
She got so upset first I thought I gave here to less tip and then I was like no it can't be. 
So she was so angry she went to the other waiters and keep on pointing to our table and she was like angry like no tomorrow. 
I was literally shocked what happen to her.  
Trying to ask but well she didn't speak English.
So I ignored them all of them. 
I don't know maybe she got mad that I couldn't finish my food.
So my advice for this place is nothing special. If you want some waiter getting angry at you for no reason sure go ahead. This place is not recommended from my side.",0
Banh Mi Boys,1,2020-03-10,"I really want to like this place. I really do. I've gone here since 2013, and then I tell myself never again, but it's so close and convenient, etc. But yeah, everytime I go I wonder why it's rated so high by everyone else.

First, banh mi shouldn't take forever to make. Go to any Vietnamese place and the person behind the counter will literally slap together a sandwich in a matter of minutes. They have a team of people working here and it still takes longer somehow.

Second, the banh mi itself (i.e., the bread) doesn't taste right. It's not crunchy on the outside, soft in the middle. As for the rest of the sandwich, there's something about it that lacks authenticity. Atop of this, it's way pricier than it should be.",0
Stelvio,3,2018-09-25,"Queen West small Italian shop with simple black and white décor, sizeable patio but limited seating inside, typical (you'll get the joke soon) Italian fair with a slight focus on risottos and pastas.

I thought just the décor was black and white, but it turned out the placemats and menus were also black and white - there's a collection of black ink art that reminds me of medieval times when artists worked for months on a simple line drawing to get things just right - whether it was embellishment in a single capital letter, or a decorative flower, or the skull of an animal - because you know, all these are completely related and belong side by side. Nothing wrong with it at all, it was definitely unique and presented artfully. 

The menu is deceptively lengthy - dishes are in Italian then described in English. I've never read a menu that uses ""typical"" as it's adjective of choice so much. Most of my party went for pastas - they were smaller portions than desired. It would've been fine as a lunch portion, but for dinner it was insufficient and taste was simpler than expected (or should I say, typical?). The risotto with veal was actually a highlight despite some other reviews and the portion was actually filling, unlike the gnocchi and ravioli items (those were the smallest!). Overall it was really not bad - but unfortunately underwhelming.

Service is very slow if you're a large group - so please spare them and only come with a few friends. You'll enjoy the ambiance more and sharing more items will be more feasible, and your overall experience will just be that much better! If I'm in the area I suppose I could give it another shot, but for one that values taste over aesthetic, I might not be back.",1
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria,3,2019-12-10,Came here for lunch with group of friends. Service was good and attentive. Food portion is small for the price. Finished the spaghetti meatballs and was still hungry. Probably will not come back.,1

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,5,2020-03-09,"Came across this restaurant while browsing food places closeby the DoubleTree hotel. It was about a 13 min walk and my boyfriend and I came at 9pm. We were thinking the crowd would die down by then but we were wrong. The restaurant was still packed. We were able to get seated quickly. 
I ordered the pad Thai and my boyfriend ordered the pad gra prow. I can't have spicy so I ordered no spice. You have the option of adjusting the spice level. My boyfriend got medium spice for his dish. He cleaned his plate good and ended up finishing mine. Portions were good for the price. Plates range starting from $15-16. Quality and flavors were there so it was a good meal. We loved the playlist they were playing and the ambiance. It was pretty loud in there with the music playing and the crowd, but we enjoyed our meal. Servers gave us great and fast service!",2
Terroni,3,2020-01-25,"I would describe this place as a trendy Italian restaurant. My review will only comment on the pizza as I haven't tried the pastas (it seems like my friends enjoyed them). 
I wasn't too impressed by the pizza, the crust was thin and quite crispy, toppings tasted fresh and good quality but not very generous. It's a good place to go for simple business meetings as the atmosphere is nice and trendy or maybe for a date but if you're looking for a more local small  business type of vibe, I would pass. 
Service was a good and fairly fast. I would mind coming back but not my first choice.",1

Mexico Lindo,3,2017-06-02,"I was really excited for this place because it had been such a long time since I've had Mexican food. While everything tasted great I was slightly disappointed by the mediocre serving sizes. And warning that the complimentary salsa is very spicy! Also, not that it's the restaurant's fault, but there's a huge sidewalk planter right in front of the entrance which made it pretty much impossible for our stroller to go through. A wheelchair would definitely not be able to pass so heads up. Otherwise seems like a casual and family-friendly place.",1
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria,3,2019-12-22,"Although the surroundings of a cellar-like space was nice, the overall pricey but subpar food, elementary plating/plates, and clumsy service was a let down especially in the Yorkville area.

I ordered their fish special of the night: Swordfish with a Side Salad. It was expensive, but the portion was great and the fish cooked & seasoned well!  The side salad was very basic but fresh, thankfully I had asked for the dressing on the side...especially since we previously ordered the Fried Calamari appetizer that came with some VERY greasy side salads. We ended our meal with some desserts, I tried their creme brûlée, but for $9.95 it was a rip off since the ramekin wasn't fully filled and the custard texture felt a little too whipped. Also, a little ridiculous that they charged us for hot water.",1
Itacate,3,2020-03-07,"Came for lunch around 12:30. The place only has two tables and some standing room. After you order and pay, they give you a number and  you seat yourself. 

The tacos all tasted good but were quite overpriced at 6 bucks each. The enchilada tasted good and was better priced at 8 bucks. 

I didn't feel the service was great, the cooks seemed annoyed when orders started piling up or when a customer asked for the provided cilantro/onions/ salsa to be refilled. Space wise the place sucks with only two tables. They also said there was not bathroom for customers ( even though if we paid). Floors and tables were not clean either. 

I also asked their facebook page a few days before my saturday visit if they have tamales. It's on the menu and some reviews on other review sites mentioned they are not usually available. I got a reply within 1 hour that they would have tamales around noon. When I asked about them, i was told they make them some weeks and not others. I do not think they are worth returning to. There are other taquerias in the city that have cleaner restaurants and friendlier staff. Take out might be ok.",1
Nodo Restaurant,3,2018-12-23,"It's ok. It's definitely not 4.5 lol. 

We got the prosciutto and ricotta fritters to start and those were great. Took a little too long to come out but they were redeeming. 

We got the oreciette (sp?) and duck tagliatelle and both fell short in different areas. The duck tagliatelle was definitely missing some flavour notes - probably lacking in aromatics- maybe garlic? Something was missing. The pasta was also way overdone for a restaurant and not al dente at all. It needed a lot more salt- and even though I got piles of parmesan on it, it was still under salted. 

The oreciette to me was the better of the two- the pasta was perfectly al dente and the chilli component made the taste better, but it was still missing something- hard to say what.

The tables adjacent to us seemed to really like their food so maybe it was just us.

We didn't get dessert so I can't speak for that. 

I would maybe come back and try to gnocchi but other than that, nothing really sparked my interest.",1
Stelvio,3,2017-10-13,"Stelvio is an Italian restaurant in Downtown Toronto. It was packed on a Saturday night and we were lucky to have a table. After glancing the menu, we placed our order. Shortly after, our server brought us a plate of Poppyseed Sesame Bread served with EVOO balsamic vinegar dipping sauce and herb marinated olives.

Based on other Yelp review, we ordered the Taroz, which consisted of crushed potatoes with green beans, butter, onion and cheese served on a iron skillet. It was to die for. The only other thing to die for was Zuppa D'Orzo Carciofi E Patate, which was a soup with barley, artichoke, potatoes, and garlic.

We're weren't too impressed with the Dante Salad, Tagialette Al Funghi Porcini, and Tagialette Al Funghi Porcini. The Dante Salad consisted of shredded pan seared chicken breast, Caesar DOP cheese, lettuce, and red chicory lightly tossed in a dijon vinaigrette. I didn't like how either Tagialette had much flavor or sauce. Tagialette Al Funghi Porcini consisted of fresh homemade tagliatelle pasta with porcini mushrooms. Tagialette Al Ragu Bianco consisted of fresh homemade tagliatelle pasta with homemade meat sauce and fried herbs including sage and rosemary.",1
Sugo,2,2020-03-09,This place is overhyped.... the food was quite mediocre however the line was out the door the entire time we were there. We tried the Spaghetti & Meatballs and the Chicken Parmesan Sandwich. The meatball was delicious. However the rest was forgettable.,0
Lee Chen Asian Bistro,3,2020-05-04,"Lee Chen is an upscale chinese restaurant in the core of the downtown area. Unlike the more dingy (or more authentic) restaurants on Spadina, Lee Chen is carefully decorated and has more catered service. It is the kind of place you bring your in-laws for family dinners and not your friends after a night out. It is deceptively large since it spans the full basement level of the building, so it is easy to find seating.

Terroni,2,2019-12-12,"Very spacious restaurant, a bonus for downtown foodies. 
The location used to be a bank, so the architecture inside is unique, interesting, and stunning.
(Be sure to visit washrooms and vaults in the bsmt.) 

The menu is not typical Italian, which was a bit disappointing for my group of 7, and they're not open to substitutions for dietary / halal purposes. 

Our server was very insistent about what we should and shouldn't apply cheese to, a quick suggestion would've been nice - but then let ppl eat how they want to!

Food was a bit bland, although their tomato sauce tastes fresh and authentic. The fresh cut hot peppers they bring to the table saved our meals. 
*Be prepared to cut the uncooked basil on the Margherita pizza yourself ‍ it's just placed uncooked in the center.  

Desserts are a different story, very nice presentation and the taste was even better! The Tiramisu & Creme Caramel were a nice end to a mehh unexciting lunch. 

Not a lot of veggie/salad/vegan options for those who have medical / religious restrictions.

We visited before COVID times for take out and this tiny place was packed (there are really only about 10 seats or so here). I believe they are offering curbside pick up but please call to make sure!

The lady, who I assumed was the owner, was really lovely and sweet. She took her order and we waited outside the shop so we weren't hovering over the seated peeps enjoying their meals.

Our order was assembled quickly. The lady who took our order also threw in a cheese enchilada for us to try, which was so lovely!

The food was absolutely delicious, the right amount of heat and the food items were packaged with care. Will definitely come back in the future for a sit down meal!",2
Mi Taco Taqueria,3,2019-02-27,"My husband and I went to this cute taqueria last week. I liked the simple ordering process of ordering your food at the counter and then eating in a tucked away back area of the narrow restaurant that was decorated with colourful pennant flags, strings of lights and wooden furniture (some high top tables, others were little booths). I appreciated the cute street food dining type of vibe in there, as well as the friendly staff at the counter and who brought the food to our table.

We ordered the carnita burrito bowl and the grilled fish burrito bowl since we thought it would be more filling than getting just the tacos. When our burrito bowls arrived, each bowl was filled with fresh vegetables, cheese and sour cream to accompany the grilled fish and pork. While the bowls were definitely filling, they were just okay in terms of flavour. I have to admit, it was a bit underwhelming considering the great reviews this place has gotten. Nothing really stood out - I would have loved to taste more of a marinade on the carnitas and the fish was a bit plain. More seasoning or sauces on the protein would have helped the flavours come together more in the burrito bowl. Again, not a horrible meal by any means but not really memorable either... personally, it was a bit of a miss for me on this particular visit but I may come back another time to try some of their other offerings to see if I can upgrade this review.",1
KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL,5,2020-05-04,"Absolutely loved this spot when I went with friends on vacation in Toronto. I love Japanese izakaya spots because it's always fun to share the dishes and it's usually a lot of unique tapas. The menu has a nice variety to choose from, including the drinks. This is a long overdue review so I don't remember all the things we got. However, I do remember we got the fried shrimp, karaage, pressed salmon sushi, yaki udon, kalbi and more. They were all packed with flavor and very delicious! The portions can be a little small for its price but the experience and how the food actually tasted made up for it. For 4 people, we split about 8 dishes. We were decently full but could have ordered more.  

The atmosphere inside is so lively! For birthdays, they take a free polaroid for your party! I thought that was so cute. There were a lot of parties doing sake bombs as well. Whenever I'm back in Toronto, I'd definitely hit up this spot again. I highly recommend!",2
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,5,2020-04-22,"I never fully understood the taco genre but my life changed when I had the Baja fish taco. Best taco I've ever had in my life. I think of it often. 

I also had the Pulpo a la Mexicana (octopus), which was also good but I definitely don't love eating octopus in a taco. Biting into a taco with crispy fish is just more satisfying than something chewy, y'know?

A warning to those who are visiting for the first time, there is almost no sitting room in this place so be prepared to bring your tacos elsewhere to eat.

Love this place.",2
Ramen Isshin,4,2020-01-15,"Food - I'm a big fan of Spicy Miso so of course I had to get that. This place is known for their spicy miso so, as you can imagine, it's really good. Their broth is rich, tasty, and has a kick to it; I LOVE IT. The noodles and condiments are pretty normal but it's still good. The ramen doesn't come with an egg though so you have to order extra for that. We had the takoyaki and gyoza too. The takoyaki was really good, it's deep fried so the outside is crispy while the inside remains juicy; not convention, I know but its good. Gyoza was pretty good too!

Ambiance - It's a relatively small restaurant with limited seats so be sure to plan ahead if you're coming in as a big group. Aside from that, everything's pretty clean and has a typical ramen shop interior.

Price - my bowl of ramen was around $16 without egg. I thought it was expensive...but its good so maybe its worth it? 

Service - Our host was pretty nice and attentive. Despite the restaurant being busy l, we were still given everything in an orderly manner. 

Overall - Great place if you're a fan of Miso style broth. I heard the other ramen spots might be better if you're not really into miso though!",2
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine,1,2019-12-24,"Worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant! 
The service was so slow; we got our food after exactly one hour. Also, the server didn't speak English, was aggressive, and had an attitude. 
Moreover, the food was served colder than usual and was extra oily. 
We tried to address the issue to the manager but he said: ""it's okay"". 
I don't recommend even giving this restaurant a try!",0
Nodo Restaurant,3,2019-05-01,"My friend recently moved to the Junction area and we decided to try this place out. Unfortunately, we didn't have a great experience. I was the first to arrive and there were quite a few empty tables on a Friday evening. The hostess said that she'd seat me when the rest of my party arrived (understandable). 5 minutes later, another customer came in (she was an older woman) and said she was waiting on 2 other people. The hostess sat her down immediately, which was a little weird to me but I didn't want to cause a scene and didn't ask about it. When the rest of my party arrived, it took them forever to seat us as it was getting busier and they were slightly understaffed. 

The food itself was good but the portions were small for the appetizers. We ordered the burrata and octopus to share. The burrata salad tasted fresh but for $20 it wasn't worth it in my opinion. Likewise, the octopus was chopped up into tiny pieces and served with potatoes. We each had about 2 tiny bites of octopus. However, the most disappointing part of the meal was the main. All four of us got the duck ragu pappardelle and I was surprised that it came with tomato sauce. The pappardelle itself tasted fresh and they were generous with the duck but too bad they were drenched in tomato sauce. I've had amazing ragu sauce at other places before and this was overwhelmingly disappointing despite it being one of their best seller. I don't think I'll be coming back here anytime soon.",1
La Chilaca Taqueria,3,2018-08-06,"3.5 stars to some more great options of 4 stars.  Not going to lie... it's true Kensington in every sense of the neighbourhood.

If you're willing to look past the rough and gritty exterior, you may find some good tacos here.  Nothing risked is nothing gained and I feel that La Chilaca Taqueria fits that perfectly.  It's in the 'food court' of several Latin American food stalls.  Food court is an understatement... It's more like a disheveled, heavily worn and dirty open non A/C store that has every stall spilling out into a small room.  It shares the space with 3 other stalls.  

There are some tables in the back of the dingy place but there's a weird smell emanating from the back as you sit beside several broken old unused glassed counters.  On a crazy hot day, the lack of A/C makes this insane and feel like an oven.  The open back door to a few more seats barely helps.  The 'kitchen' is really a small stove top and a crammed setting of a kitchen sink and a counter to assemble.  

You're quickly greeted and told to look up at the menu.  There are daily deals like 2 chorizo tacos for $5 or 4 other tacos for $10.  Each taco is $5 each regardless of the type.  When we went, the carnitas werent ready but they had 8 other ones you could try.  Service here is efficient but I have to admit they were all busy with the World Cup... can't blame them since the entire Kensington (let's be real... Toronto) is watching.  I do have to worry a bit when we overheard the person in the kitchen saying how can they cook this chicken in under 3 minutes... ehhhh wut?  How about cooking it till it's done?

I have to admit the addition of their sauces really perked these up so grab some before taking a bite into them.  The creamy orange one has some good heat that could make you water up a bit if you're not careful.  I wasnt expecting that type of heat and wow, yeah... ice cream was needed to cool my tongue.  What I thought would be the spicy red transparent sauce was actually a tomato one that didn't have any heat and just added a little bit of flavour.  There was also a nice vibrant green sauce that was very good mix of mild jalalpeno, onions, and cilantro.  Totally refreshing to add.

Fish Taco - My favourite of the tacos.  The fish pan fried and still tender without being dried out.  This was a stuffed taco... the type where you take a bite and you realize that the sauce and pickled onions are just going to be exploding soon.  The sauce just oozes out onto your hand and you're soon licking your fingers.  The cilantro just gives a nice freshness to it... I know, not everyone likes cilantro but it's good on this one.  Another thing I love about this... they double wrap the taco so they dont fall apart easily AND they toast the corn tortilla up so they're a bit crispy.  Nice one. 4/5 

Vegetable Taco - Soooo I keep ordering Vegetable Tacos and I keep wondering why afterwards.  My search for a good one continues but I learned that tofu and cheese really doesn't work... at... all.  I feel like you do one or the other.  It's just a weird combination.  In addition to those, they had cilantro, pickled onion, and tomatoes. This one wasn't as flavourful so it really benefits from either the orange hot sauce (that will scorch you) or green fresh herb one.  3/5

Chorizo Taco - Another solid taco with the paprika giving the pork a nice flavour.  It was cooked fresh from the sausage and it didnt taste like it was standing in some pot for a few hours.  They garnished with pickled onions and cilantro and helped cut through the rich meat.  I was told this was authentic to the style in Mexico city.  4/5  

Beef Taco - Maybe I wasn't in the mood for cheese but the beef and cheese one didn't quite work.  As generous as they were with the cheese... I just felt this one was really quite heavy and a bit oily.  The beef was possibly a bit overcooked which made it a bit on the dry side.  I could have added more sauce to it but something didn't quite work as well as the chorizo.  3/5

Shrimp Taco - This was a solid one with small shrimps cooked fairly well.. they werent rubbery or dried out.  Just a nice juicy chew.  They added a spice to it that kept it out of the bland side ... though I have to admit, this wasn't as flavourful as the Chorizo.  This one does work well with a sauce to keep it from being boring.  They did garnish with the usual pickled onions and cilantro.  3.5/5

There are some really good tacos coming out of here and made freshly with some in house made sauces that really make the tacos pop.  BUT if you're the type where you're concerned about atmosphere, this might put you off.  Worse case, you can take it to go and eat it while you're walking about Kensington but just bring a few napkins, ok a lot... cause you're going to be leaving a trail of food dripping otherwise!",1
DaiLo,5,2018-12-03,"I had heard a little buzz about Dai Lo from some friends visiting from out of town. They raved about their Chef's menu and I knew I had to try it. I made reservation a couple days ahead of time... for a Wednesday dinner. They had no problem fitting us in. 

My first impression was a classy fusion between asian and western decor. Cozy, and not at all pretentious. I had to wait about 20 minutes for my friend, but I ordered myself a cocktail. The staff were polite and didn't give me a hard time about not being ready on time. 

We selected the Chef's choice menu and we had absolutely no idea what an emotional, and gastronomical adventure awaited us. If I go over my photos, I think I can count 11 separate dishes. Some small, some sizeable... all unique and heavenly. All of that for $67 pp?!? It's a steal.

I am not going to describe all the items, because I don't want to spoil it for you (and I don't recall). I really appreciate that they check for allergies and general dislikes before you start ordering. They explain each dish carefully and give you enough time between the dishes to savour and enjoy every bite. 

If you are not able to finish the last few dishes, they will pack it up for you. Left over fried rice + braised beef for lunch...mmm

Just like this review, I can ramble on about Dai Lo and not make any sense. I highly recommend you experience it for yourself.",2
El Catrin Destileria,5,2019-06-18,"I come here several times a year and its still the best! One of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. 

2 years ago they had a dish called the Love Boat which was one of my fav dishes but they discontinued it. I stopped coming as often because of that but decided to revisit for the guac! OH MY GOD. Best.Guac.Ever. They will crush and make the guac in front of you which is a cool personal touch. The flavour is just right! You can taste the hint of lime, the onions and tomatoes! To top it off, the chips they provide are to die for... 

I would also highly recommend the original margarita! One of my favs!! My friend and I once ordered a pitcher and both got pretty drunk off it haha! Perfect amount of tequila in each glass and overall just the perfect amount of sweetness. 

In terms of atmosphere, the inside is pretty dim with loud music. I've sat inside once and can say it is definitely an experience. I did the tasting menu that time, and i believe it was $65/person and you get to experience a bit of everything! Definitely worth it if you have the appetite, I was too full for the best part... the dessert... WHICH TO MENTION, WAS MY FAV PART! I have to talk about the churro.... LITERALLY THE BEST. Nice and thick, with a crunch, very warm, and also the perfect amount of cinnamon sugar! 

Taco portions are also huge. I think I can write an essay because I've tried almost everything on this menu. HIGHLY RECOMMEND",2
Asian Legend,3,2017-12-11,"We had a team member who was leaving work to pursue his dream job and we took him out for lunch. This place was suggested and quickly liked by a few.   

The restaurant managers/owners generally I think underestimate the power of mentioning a bit more details on the menu or at least a server who is knowledgeable about ingredients. In the absence of information I went the safest route of ordering a plain congee and a steamed bun. My order would easily have been more than double if the right information was provided. 

So on the limited items that I could have, my review is not a review per se. One cannot mess up a Congee and a bun.

However the food did not arrive all together and out of respect for others, all of us had to wait. Which resulted in food going cold. 

The congee and bun were as good as they can be",1

Small portions",0
Dumpling House Restaurant,3,2019-09-14,"Service was as ok, dumplings are ok (depends) place is kinda gross. 

If you're not picky then this place might have good dumplings for you, just ignore the poor cleanliness of the place then you're good! The plates they use look old, and I question the cleanliness of the stuff they use. I saw a pile of serving plates near the front where they're cooking and I couldn't figure out if it was the dirty pile or the clean pile.

Service is prompt, I've been here a couple of times. My first time was with my s.o., who is white. We pretty much got ignored most of the time, the only time they attended to us was to ask for our order and to pay. 

The second time was with my Chinese friend, she spoke in Mandarin to them and I noticed they actually filled up my water a couple of times, I have no idea if it's cause I went with her.

Now for the dumplings, my friend said that the wrapper they used was too thick for her liking, and she said it made sense since they used dough. I didn't mind but the filling of the dumpling had a gross bitterness to it, and this comes from someone that willingly eats bitter melon. The pan fried one tasted better, but near the end we got sick from eating it cause of the oil, it pooled at the bottom.

The first time I went here, I only got steamed dumplings, I got the mushroom and spinach one and it was tasty. My boyfriend got steamed pork dumplings and he didn't complain, although he seldom does. I definitely think it's a must try but you can only pay in cash so make sure you bring some. If you're with TD, you might need to trek a bit if you want an ATM, otherwise CIBC, RBC and Scotiabank clients are good since the ATMs are in close proximity",1
Ramen Isshin,5,2020-01-06,"Cozy Ramen place with excellent service! Loved the spicy miso Ramen - I liked how the Ramen was loaded with sprouts, gave it a different feel altogether! Pork was amazing and juicy! I also tried their sake cocktail- I am a sake lover now! 
Definitely visiting again !",2
7 Numbers Restaurant,1,2017-07-08,"We came to this place attracted by BlogTO's boast of the best lasagna in town. What's a better way to try the place then the Family Meal it has on the menu. For a set price you get to try a little bit of all their well known food.

It comes with appetizers, salads, pasta, and a main course to share.  With all the rave reviews, we thought we were going to have the best meal of our lives.

To note: Their Lasagna was pretty good. It comes in the menu as a small for just under $10 or a bigger pasta size.  I will return just for that.

Everything else, my companion and I were pretty disappointed.  Granted, it should be pretty hard to screw up a salad. Most is just compilation of freshly chopped up raw ingredients.  One of the salads was dressed REALLY sour.  I ended up taking it home and tossing it with more raw vegetables to be palatable.

The pasta sampler plate they provided came with 3 pasta of their choices - this included the legendary lasagna.  It was the ONLY good thing on the plate. One of the pasta was undercooked so it was still crunchy. We had to send it back to be more ""al dente.""

The only control of choice you have was the main dish. We were able to each choose 2 mains individually -  a pork chop and a lamb shank.  That being the highlight of the meal, we were both pretty disappointed too.  The pork chop was way overcook and tough. The lamb shank - well...we had better elsewhere.

We expected a lot more going into the restaurant especially paying over $100 including wine. We both agree afterwards we should had just gotten a lasagna and that's it.

This place was not horrendous but I would not go out of my way to return.",0
Carisma,3,2019-02-12,"I have frequently gone by this restaurant, and was curious to try it out. I dined here for a business meeting with several of my colleagues.

The ambiance and decor is elegant and romantic overall, and the staff are very welcoming and hospitable.

Carisma has been an establishment in Toronto for years, and I was eager to try it out based on recommendations.

Upon entering, I was greeted by very hospitable staff. The restaurant was entirely empty upon my arrival, which I found to be unusual given that it was peak dinner time.

Our server was attentive and knowledgeable and had great recommendations about specials that evening and the menu. 

My colleague and I decided to share the Grilled Calamari appetizer, which was quite flavorful in nature with the addition of olives and herbs. Although I didn't partake in the bread, my colleague mentioned that it was quite soft and delicious overall!

For our entrees, we ordered the SeaBass Filet which according to my companion was well-seasoned and delicious overall; another colleague asked for a 'surprise' entree and was presented with a combined dish of the gnocchi and agnolotti, which she enjoyed. My entree was the ahi tuna dish which I was excited about; however, I must admit that this was overdone. It was presented as an entire tuna steak, which was likely the issue in the cook overall, as had it been sliced tuna, there may have been more control over the cook. I had asked for it to be rare, and it was far more than well-done, and even charred on one side. 

Overall, I am glad that I tried this establishment. I commend the staff and service for their efforts.",1
Stelvio,3,2018-03-23,"Hovering between 3 and 4 stars. The food was delicious to be sure, but the price point was extremely high for the portions we received. I realized the pasta is made in house so that accounts for a lot of it, but it still just felt pretty pricey given we didn't really order that much and got pretty hungry again a few hours later.

My husband ordered the ravioli (8 small ravioli in dish. It was FANTASTIC but a tiny portion) and I had the mushroom tagliatelle (also great but just mushrooms tossed in a light sauce with a bit of parsley). We also split the chocolate cake for dessert and I had a glass of wine and the whole tab came out to around $70. WHAT. The night before we ate at another restaurant with dishes packed with seafood, veggies, meat, and more and we spent the same amount of money for around 8-9 small plates of food. And everything was made from scratch there as well. 

The experience was nice, and the food was good but I would probably not return given you can get more for your money in Toronto at other locations and have an equally delicious meal.",1
El Nahual Tacos,5,2017-12-01,"I found this place thanks to my wife as we were taking a shortcut as the 401 East was very busy (more than usual) and decided to go through the local roads. Since it was close to dinner time, she found El Nahual through the Yelp app. She was craving Mexican! It was Tacos Thursday. 

This place is by Eglinton West on a one way street. Tiny place located amidst the constant construction and traffic around the area. Ideal for takeout as they have very limited seating and space. Even the outside signage is unassuming. There are some pay parking on the front of the store but there's a 3 hour free parking if you turn right in the next street. 

My wife and I ordered the same 3 tacos: Gringa, Steak and Shrimp. All of them were very good but the shrimp is the winner. My wife and I would rate the Gringa (Pork) for least favourite. I loved their tortillas. You do have to wait for your tacos as they do per order and they are not premade but that's a small price to pay for such delicious tacos. We washed down the tacos with a Pellegrino drink and a Horchata.

As much as I want to come back, we are rarely in the area but now we know where to come in order to try the other tacos in the menu. It seems that some of the dishes sells out throughout the day so come early if possible. 

Highly recommended!",2
Terroni,2,2019-10-20,"This restaurant is really for the experience. With such a lovely ambience and outstanding service from all staff, the food did not meet up to par with what you may expect.

For starters the food is on the higher price end, and smaller quantities. Although, it is all homemade pasta!! 

I've had homemade pasta before so I had high standards walking in.. I was so excited to try the Gnocchi because well, I LOVE Gnocchi. 

However, I was disappointed. The pasta itself was quite soft and seemed soggy with the red sauce altogether. There was no 'bite' to it, more of a 'mush'. I did not enjoy my meal and that left a significant impression on my take of what the rest of the entrees may be like. 

Note: Calamari & Earl Grey tea were delicious!",0
Fudao noodle house,3,2019-04-13,"Fudao is a standard noodle house that gives really generous portions! 

I was actually expecting it to be more of a dipping noodle situation after seeing the photos but it's actually more of a hot pot since you're supposed to toss in all of the toppings and noodles in your broth immediately before it cools. 

For the price, I think it's a solid spot that will definitely fill you up. The service was just OK. I was surprised that there was a decent amount of seating. If you're visiting, it's not a must but if you're looking for a place to get a substantial amount of food for a good price it's worth trying.",1
Ramen Isshin,3,2020-02-16,"I was so excited to come here based on the number of reviews that said this was ""the best ramen in Toronto"". 

I was underwhelmed. The spicy red miso ramen had zero flavor and zero spice. 

Service was great and friendly. I joined the waitlist on Yelp while we were ubering from Union. By the time we got there we waited less than five minutes. 

You just put yourself on the waitlist and once you get there you check in with the host. They text you once your table is ready. Very efficient.

Sugo,5,2020-01-20,"Went on a Monday, came right at opening and they quickly filled up to full house of happy diners within the hour. Having finally experienced the hype, can safely say it's worth it! There's the option of doing a 50/50 split platter if you're indecisive like me, which two of us ordered a veal parm/gnocchi platter and their burrata to share. Burrata was on a bruschetta based, thick cut of garlic-y bread with all that cheese  The veal parm was tender and coated with mozz, gnocchi was fresh and soft, along with the Aperol spritz - such a good meal 
.",2
La Carnita,3,2018-12-16,"There's lots of mixed reviews for this restaurant. Glowing reviews versus one that speak of terrible service. My review errs on the side of the not so good. I'd say 2.5 stars for me.

Are all Mexican restaurants so dim? It seems that the ones I've been to are always so dark and hard to see. In terms of price it's on the pricey side. My friend took me to a food truck in LA and it was either $1 or $1.50 per taco. I suppose you're paying for the atmosphere and sit down service but ~$6/taco is quite the surcharge. I'll give them that the carne asada taco was tasty but in my opinion that still doesn't justify paying so much per taco. They're small so it's not like you're going to have just 1.

I saw horchata on the menu and decided to try it here. It was very watered down. I didn't taste any cinnamon at all either. definitely not worth $4. 

The server told us that they want to be the best fried chicken place in Toronto. I'd say that they have quite a ways to go until they can claim that title. Perhaps it was just the pieces I got but the skin was soft and not crispy. It was also kinda bland without slathering it in sauce. Turns out the dip that we had with the chips was a better accompaniment for the fried chicken instead of the sauce it came with. Go figure. 

That's a lot of negatives that I've listed. The positives are that our server was great and available when we needed her, the atmosphere was good, we were comfortable and didn't feel rushed to finish our meal. Although, paying for our bill took some time. Maybe the person taking payment didn't realize we were ready to pay because our server came back around after about 15 min of us waiting to speed up the process. 

I'd spent almost $30 and left unsatisfied with value for money and felt like I hardly had anything to eat.",1
Grazie Ristorante,1,2020-03-05,We arrived at 9:34 pm two times and they didn't let us to be seat because kitchen is closed. Operation hours indicated til 10 pm and they blocked customer come in 30mins before that doesn't make sense.,0
Lai Wah Heen,3,2019-07-26,"Came to Lai Wah Heen with my family to try out their peking duck as I had received a coupon for a free order. Growing up in Scarborough and being completely surrounded by Chinese restaurants, and being Chinese myself, I've had my fair share of Chinese cuisine. Upon arrival, I knew right away it would be a different vibe as it was located inside a hotel and everything looked fairly nice. 

The staff was helpful and polite though a bit stiff. Nonetheless our order was accurate and the tea was always filled. We had dinner on a Tuesday night so it wasn't overly busy but there were some larger parties dining.

On to the food: so as I said, I'm Chinese and have grown up around eating this food in and outside of the house. We ordered about 9 dishes for 7 people including peking duck, stir-fried beef flavoured with aged mandarin peel, sweet and sour pork w/ lychee, gailon vegetables, pineapple chicken fried rice, soy sauce fried rice noodle with beef and fried chicken. First impressions, the food looked nice but was pretty small portions and cost a pretty penny more than what you get uptown. Not surprising with this being a downtown hotel restaurant. The taste though was really really good. Everything was delicious and had lots of flavour. Presentation was pretty and at the end we ordered enough to feel full though not without a price. 

Overall, the food was delicious, the service was good but price for the amount of food was just a bit too much for myself. They are other options out there for upscale Chinese food that might possibly be less expensive and closer to my neck of the woods.",1
El Charro,2,2020-04-18,"I added this to my list based on good Yelp reviews. We ordered a takeaway - burrito, quesadilla and corn chips. Overall the food was not fresh, the burrito was average and quesadilla lacked any flavor. Corn chips were overly salty and guac was not fresh. I will try again...",0
Dumpling House Restaurant,5,2019-05-12,"If you're ever in a mood for dumplings and hot and sour soup, take a stroll down Chinatown and make your way to this hole in the wall restaurant and prepare for some delicious dumplings and more!

We started off with the hot and sour soup and a spicy potato dish to entice our appetite and clear my sinuses since I was a little sick. The hot and sour soup was one of the better soups I've had over the years and the spicy potato dish wasn't too spicy but an appetizer to share amongst the table. After a little wait the two dishes of pan friend dumplings came and let me tell you, I've never been this excited to see dumplings until now. They were crunchy, juicy from the pork inside and coated with a little bit of oil on the outside which added a nice flavour coating to the dumplings.

All in all I would definitely come here again on a rainy day and suggest this restaurant to all of my friends! 5/5 stars for the food and the staff were very nice to me and my girlfriend as well. No issues anywhere!",2
Tacos El Asador,1,2020-02-14,"It is Valentine's Day, I was so happy my boyfriend came from the Netherlands to visit and we had the best day exploring the city, afterwards we were too tired to go out so opted to order in some good Mexican food! 

We consider ourselves taco connoisseurs, and often indulge in a tasty tactac. We were VERY excited to have so many taco options so we ordered 3 soft shells and 3 crispy shells (as other Mexican enthusiasts may know, is not as common as people may think to have both shells) 

To provide more context you didn't ask for ... this was the first MUCH anticipated spot on our taco tour of Toronto. 

We have a methodical and detailed evaluation system in place for reviewing and ranking our tacsperiences - the system ranks the following on a scale of 1-5 (5 being the best) ;

Crunch (0)

Cheese Quality (0 - cheese unaccounted for, still looking for it)

Furthermore, we are highly liberal individuals. Our disappointment is immeasurable yet our day is not ruined, because we still have each other, and our view is lovely (will include pic)

Mi Taco Taqueria,3,2019-08-30,"This place is a very busy spot downtown and it's the type of place you come and go or take it to go because of how tight the space is. I got the 3 type plate and they're okay. They're not bad but not amazing either (bear in mind, I eat a lot of tacos). Definitely worth trying out if you're already in the area but would I take an hr TTC ride to come here again? Nope.",1
Mi Taco Taqueria,3,2019-05-03,"Hidden away on Queen West is this blink and you'll miss it taco joint. The interior is roughly the size of a shoebox, decorated festively, with a fake slanted roof. The roof makes it feel unnecessarily cramped. 

This place was rather disappointing. I brought my friends here because I enjoyed it a lot the first time around, but this visit was nowhere as good. The service here was wonderfully efficient, but the food was disappointing. I ordered the 3 taco plate (2 carnitas, 1 chicken tinga), chips and salsa verde, and a margarita. My total bill was around $22, which was not bad. The margarita was the best part of my order. 

Unlike other places, the margarita was strong. I got a good buzz from just one glass of margarita. It wasn't too sweet or tart or artificial-tasting, but rather perfectly balanced. The same cannot be said for the similarly green salsa verde. With saltier chips, the salsa might have tasted better, but with the very plain tortilla chips, the salsa tasted underseasoned and very vinegary - badly in need of salt. 

The tacos were similar in taste - while the freshness of the ingredients inside can be tasted, there wasn't enough of it, and it was hard to tell the difference between the chicken and the pork. A bit more seasoning could have helped. Lastly, the corn tortillas were absolutely dreadful. I had several mouthfuls of dry tortilla without filling to give it flavor and much-needed moisture, and it was like eating paper. I think the tortillas were kept under heat lamps for just a bit too long.

In summary, I'd come for the margaritas, but would not consider it this the best tacos in town.",1
Chop Chop,3,2018-12-10,"Let me first say that I was walking into this restaurant expecting to give this place a 4-star (if not 5-star review). I was skeptical of the reviews that rated this place under 4-stars because of raving reviews from co-workers of mine. However, that co-worker went to this place the Friday before I came and also deemed the quality has declined. So maybe it is worthwhile reading on my review as to why that's the case.

My friend and I ordered three things so i'll describe each item below- starting with the best.

1. Green beans- if all the other food was as good as this one, I would've given this place a 4-star review. Fresh, flavorful, and on-point. The wringly green beans stir-fried into the peppers and mushrooms were fantastic. However, this was a very small plate for it to cost $11. Quality: 4.5/5. Price for the food amount: 3/5.

2. Fried rice- this was their featured fried rice and a recommendation from the co-worker. I'm not a fried rice person to begin with but chose this because of the rec. This was just fried rice I could get at any chinese restaurant in chinatown for probably 75% of this cost. It was a lot but not memorable. Quality: 3.5/5. Price for the food amount: 4/5 

3. Boiled pork and chive dumplings- having chosen the healthier version of the dumpling options (versus fried), these turned out to be the most disappointing meal here. The dough/skin of the dumpling was very thick (and this is my greatest fear). The ratio of meat to skin was probably 1:2.5. Quality: 2/5. Price for the food amount: 3/5. You can get the same dumplings but WAYYYYYY better at dumpling house in Chinatown. Thank me later and go there.

So in conclusion, if you're looking for the hype of this place that came from BlogTO or other reviewers, this place will not meet your standards. I would go elsewhere for chinese food- specifically Chinatown; unless you want the aesthetics and hip vibe, then this place got that nailed down.",1
Ha Gow Dim Sum House,3,2018-08-27,"I think I set my expectations too high for this place. Being chinese I keep hearing how good the dim sum was in toronto. I studied Yelp for a good while trying to find a dim sum place with good reviews. I looked at all different menus from different places and decided on this place. It was cash only so I had money exchanged after we crossed into Canada. We drove 2 hours (there was traffic) to get there. Had to pay for parking. It was a small hole in the wall place with literally 8 small tables total. I've been in many hole in the walls so no judging there...especially if the taste of the food was out of this world good! Not in this case...I must say that I've had better dim sum at a mediocre place in VA. MD by far has the best dim sum so if you're in the Rockville area, try out the dim sum there, both Cantonese and Taiwanese style! 
Anyways my family liked it but their not Chinese (my mixed family of Blasians) so to them, dim sum is dim sum. They did agree that we have better dim sum back home in VA/MD. 
The selection wasn't as great either but I did see the cook in the back making the dumplings fresh. My youngest son love dumplings and he commented that it wasn't as good as my mom's lol. Duh..of course grandma makes the best dumplings. 
The server was very nice but we wont be back. Dont believe the hype! Or at least not from here.",1
Ho Ho Barbeque,3,2018-02-27,"FOOD: 2.5 stars
PRICE: 4 stars
SERVICE: 4 stars

I came here after reading many good reviews about how tasty their food was.  I looked for something to grab it home after picking up my adorable macarons at DaanGo Cake lab.


We ordered 3 boxes of meat on rice; one with roasted pork, another one was roasted duck and the last one was bbq pork.  It comes with either tofu or vegetable on the side.  We only chose vegetable because my husband isn't a fan of tofu. You can also choose to have either a drink or soup along with your meal too.  The price for bbq meat on rice is around $6.50-$8.50.  Isn't it a good deal?  The staff was very nice and friendly.  I wasn't sure if they were the owners or not. I really couldn't tell.  I don't live in the area and it was my first time here. 

The portion was generous however the meat was quite dry.  The bbq pork was ok.  It was better than the roasted pork and roasted duck.  The roasted pork wasn't crispy as I expected and there was little meat on the roasted duck.  

As all above, the food I ordered was mediocre or maybe it wasn't my day.  Anyway, the price was good.  Three meals were only $22.50!  It's pretty good right!?",1
Giulietta,3,2019-05-19,"Had my bday dinner at the counter seating in front of the kitchen, a great spot to watch the chef cooking the dishes. Food was great except the pasta. It's raw, not Al dente. We ordered the octopus. The portion size of each piece has a quite big difference. Wonder if they give s bigger portion for a large table. As we only had two people, we ordered the pork chop instead of the porterhouse. It's lovely cooked with cheeky pink inside. The highlight was the dessert, pine nut tart with wildflower honey and vanilla mascarpone. It's not too sweet with balanced flavour. 
The kitchen gave us a piece of choco tarte as bday cake. It's funny that the candle light was off three times as it's windy above our seats. 
I'd love to try their pizza in the future. However I doubt if I will go again coz they don't seem like to chat with asians",1
Lai Wah Heen,3,2018-06-17,"Lai Wah Heen offers excellent service and good food. The prices are higher compared to restaurants in Chinatown nearby, but you are paying for better service and food. 

The service is always great here. Servers are attentive and friendly. The atmosphere is casual. Overall, I enjoy most of the items I've had here. You will not leave disappointed if you have a dinner here. The service and food are both great. 

However, I am only giving it a 3 stars because I think the prices are high for what you get. Yes, the food is better than some of the cheaper restaurants in Chinatown. However, it isn't anything exceptional to me for the price they charge. It is priced higher because it is in a great location perhaps. For the prices here, I am expecting more unique items.",1
La Chilaca Taqueria,3,2018-11-24,"I came here to try out some tacos.  The tacos average in price about $5 each.  They have different sauces that you can put on your tacos.   I tried the pork tacos.  While it wasn't bad, it wasn't memorable either.  

This place is located inside and there are other businesses inside as well.  It was hot and stuffy.  The restaurant wasn't the cleanest either.  

Overall, it was just ok.  A bit cheaper than the more famous place across the street.",1
Magical Taste of China,1,2019-08-17,"This place is not as good as expected because of the following reasons:

1. Shredded lamb with pancakes were dry and not fresh and portions for the lamb skewers were extremely small compared to some other tables. They should have equal portion sizes for all customers. 
2. The Western Chinese lamb rice is a strange combination of what seemed like sweet potato and the rice was clumped together. It did not taste good. 
3. The membership system is ridiculous as the normal prices have a huge difference for each item listed on the menu. They should provide members to have a discount over the total bill instead. 
4. My friend had food poisoning shortly after leaving the restaurant.

For these reasons, I would be reluctant to come back as there are many places that offer much better quality and portions.",0
GB Hand-pulled Noodles,3,2019-02-14,"This place is conveniently located a couple blocks from Dundas TTC station. It is also a block from Eaton Centre. The place is a bit crammed and a bit small, so be sure to give some waiting time if you are going at noon.

We ordered the special Lanzhou beef noodles. There are a variety of noodle options in varying thickness. The portions are sufficient for some people, but as I am a big eater, I wasn't full from the large. The noodles are good. The soup is a bit bland. And the beef isn't quite flavourful. There is not much memorable about this place, except that the prices are quite unreasonable with respect to the quality.

Overall, I would not recommend this place, but I haven't yet come across a good place for hand-pulled noodles to recommend.",1
Mexico Lindo,3,2018-07-20,"I'm all for small, authentic , family run business , and this is exactly what you get at Mexico Lindo. 
My friend and I visited on a Wednesday afternoon & we were one of two tables. I ordered the guacamole, & fish tacos (on special on Wednesday's) & my friend ordered the beef chimichanga. 
The guacamole was amazing- lasted us 3-4 refills of chips. It was fresh, smooth & the perfect consistency. I just wish it came with better salsa (tasted like the basic Tostitos one out of the jar). 
The fish tacos- were okay at most. Not much flavour in the tacos (I've had better at JOEYS & other chain restos). Their rice however was fresh & delicious and their salad tasted like a Greek salad but was still very good. Also- there was nothing spicy or flavourful about the dish which is why I was  disappointed. 
The chimichangas- my friend ordered beef but got chicken. Not the biggest deal to us but still odd how the waitress forgot when we were one of two tables. She liked her dish and it was so filling! 

Overall, my friend and I both left with take out boxes because of how filling everything was. Majority - if not all- plates come with beans, rice & salad. Service and food were mediocre at best (the birchmount express location is much better) but I will come back here to support the family's business.",1
Campechano Taquería,5,2020-02-22,Ignore the bad reviews and come try this place. As a Mexican and self proclaimed taco expert I'd eat these tacos religiously if i could. The guac is perfect and the salsa roja has the perfect kick.,2
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine,3,2019-10-18,"We ordered dim sums. They were all very good. But the service was a little slow: we had to ask twice for some tea, twice for the bill, and never got the sauce we asked for. It looks like no waiter in particular was in charge of our table.",1
7 Numbers Restaurant,2,2016-05-02,"Tasty food, but a bit of a disappointment.

I booked a big party for my brother's birthday people. They were incredible about this, they kept in communication with me and were actually able to accommodate 26 adults and 6 babies with a week's notice, which grew to 32 adults, then shrunk back to 26 once we got there. Flakiness. 

We all had the $34 prix fixe, which meant three apps and three pastas shared family style and an individual entree dish. I was sitting at a table with 11 other people, and we didn't get enough food. Each of the sharing dishes was a dinner plate size, shared across all 12 of us, leaving everyone with literally 2 soup spoons full of each item. This was a huge surprise to me as I've eaten at the Danforth location with the same sort of setup - big party, shared plates, except we had the same size of dish for 4 people. 

The other tables in our party (table of maybe 8 adults and 4 kids, and another table with 5 adults and two kids) got the same amount of food, and they were pretty stuffed. We ended up asking for a second portion of the pasta, because it really was a very small amount of food per person, especially considering the price of the meal. The server balked at this, but gave us another serving, which was devoured in a second. 

The food itself was very good (though the osso buco was a bit bland), and for the most part, the service was great, but unfortunately the dinner ended with a table of adults who were still hungry.",0
Eataly,4,2020-02-20,"This review is strictly on the takeout/ market section. Overall the place is lively, clean and nicely decorated. Service is just alright.... Weekends are generally much more busier. If you go during off hours, it's so much more relaxing to maneuver around. Prices are somewhat reasonable for the fresh items but quite pricey for the imported items, but this is expected since it's located at Yonge and Bloor. 

I love their fresh mozzarella but too bad they already increased the price since opening. :( The pizzas are also tasty and is first come first serve. You only get to choose whatever is available on display at the point of ordering. I think 1.5 slices would have properly filled me. $6-$9 per slice. The fresh pastas are alright, seems like they make it earlier in the day so it doesn't taste that fresh. Overall,  nice environment with an assortment of italian antipasto, savoury dishes, desserts and coffee!",2

Fudao noodle house,3,2019-04-29,"If you dine at Fudao, you should expect a very generous portion of food (due to their unlimited noodle refill) for an extremely reasonable price. However, what stops me from giving this place a higher rating is that I didn't find myself wanting more throughout the meal. 

I tried the Fudao rice noodle and thai curry and Teppan grill squid skewer. I expected the squid to have a nice grilled/smoky taste but when it came to the table, it appeared to have just been boiled(?) and dipped in sauce. The rice noodle dish presentation is pleasant at first, but then you have to dump all the sides immediately into the boiling pot in order to have everything cooked properly. Once this is done, it becomes just like any other noodle dish. The meat was actually surprisingly soft/tender but only 3 pieces will come with the meal.

Regardless, Fudao does seem to be a popular restaurant in Toronto and was packed when I came, so perhaps it's worth a visit. Personally though, if I was back in town, I wouldn't go out of my way for it unless I just wanted to get full for a cheap price.",1
Trattoria Taverniti,3,2019-06-14,"Trattoria taverniti is a little place in Little Italy downtown. Staff are very nice and the decorations are very homie. I ordered the rigatoni bolognese and the pasta is uncooked but that's how it is served but it was very good ! The flavor was good the sauce was just right and there was lots of meat in it! My friend ordered the spaghetti and it was a bit salty for him and it was uncooked a bit. The Quattro formaggi was good and very cheesy and oil ! 
The only bad thing was the service it was very very slow. My friend finished his food before us and we had to wait about another 15-20 mins for our dishes to come. Also asking for water took a while to get their attention because they were all zooming by the tables. 

Overall though the food here is quite good but a little pricey",1
Xola Mexican Food,3,2018-09-28,"It is pretty hard to find good Mexican food in Toronto ( at least veggie) and I'm not talking about the good ole beans and cheese on tortilla! Anyway, this restaurant is NOT in that ""off the hook"" food category. 

Dinner with hubby and child on a Friday evening was alright. This place is pretty small and can accommodate 18-20 people total in the restaurant, sitting is pretty tight. 
Service- mediocre, we had to ask for stuff every time as no one really ""checked in"" on us, excepted once towards the end. 
Price- comparable to other restaurants in the neighbourhood. 
Food- ""average"", nothing different than other Mexican restaurants around. 
Rating- 2.5-3/5",1
Mariachi’s Restaurant,3,2013-10-12,"First things first: Great service! They were so polite, friendly and for the most part fast 

The margaritas were fantastic! I will definitely be back for those! However, the food left my taste buds in complete disappointment!! The appetizer was alright- everything was bland for myself and my boyfriend. 

Entrees: my boyfriend ordered the beef enchiladas. They looked fantastic and I would know, I was looking at his meal for awhile.. I was kept waiting for my chicken enchiladas for about an additional 5-10 minutes after he got his. When it finally came, my rice was cold! Not to mention? I found a hair in it. I pretty much lost my appetite right there. But I was just too hungry in the end- so I ate around my nasty rice. Again, food was bland! For Mexican food, I expect bold flavours and spices... I got none of this. Not to mention, the ""spicy"" sauce was not even a hint of spice in there. 

I gave them three stars because they were über nice and the service was good. However, this is a Mexican place I won't be visiting again for the food.",1
Fudao noodle house,2,2019-02-04,"Cute concept, but the toppings are absolutely horrible! The price is very very low, but I found myself paying less for great food in Chinatown so the low price does not play any factor here.

The toppings to be put into the broth are of the lowest quality. The meat is severely freezer burned and sort of breaks apart in the broth once cooked. Their sausage also tastes like couch medicine in liquid form.. why? Fudao seemed like the perfect place on a freezing Toronto night for me to warm up, but I regretted my decision more and more with each bite that I took.",0
Zhang’s Kitchen,4,2019-12-09,"I heard the buzz of this new joint and just had to check it out. I was darn skeptical... since it was completely empty at 6pm~ on a Saturday night. 

But hey! It's their soft opening... so gave it a go and was pleasantly surprised with their delicious braised beef noodle. Very satisfying, came in a thick savory sauce (curry consistency) and juicy beef chunks.  The potatoes were a nice touch along with the noodles that just soaks up the sauce. In the end, my belly was super happy. More places need to do braised beef noodles like this! Next time I'll definitely come back and try their soup noodle, but with their stir fry saucy noodle stealing the show, hard to say the soup noodle would be as good.  

We also ordered a side garlic broccoli and loved the tangy garlic sauce that it came with, so appetizing and just made me crave for it more. The sauce was probably some kind of Chinese vinegar, sugar and garlic concoction but when I tried doing it at home couldn't get it quite right. 

Service was just alright gotta ask to get water-filled and decor is whatever - clean. Though they forgot we added extra bok choy in one order. Instead of just going in the kitchen and getting some bok choy on the side, they took the whole bowl of noodle and cooked and added it in... what a tease, especially when you're hungry and you want to eat and have to wait again. But hey I don't expect much from a casual Chinese restaurant. 

Ps - they still offer 10% off with cash.",2
Donatello Restaurant,3,2018-12-02,"Super average food with inflated prices. It's a small place so you have to make reservations even on a week night. 
The veggie pasta that I got (linguine with cream sauce and mushrooms) costed me 20 bucks without tax. The pasta was al dente which I liked but lacked much flavour. The portion size on the other hand was big. 
The calamari was also around $20 but was well cooked. I just wish we got more pieces :( They charred it nicely but by the time it made it to our table it was cold. 
The sever talked super fast but was friendly and happy. Not sure if I will return because I wasn't impressed with anything!",1
Fusaro’s Kitchen,3,2018-11-30,"A cheerful relaxed place to grab a large bowl of hot pasta that will fill you up and keep you carb happy. The pasta isn't freshly made (I don't think so at least) but the addition of quality sauces and fresh ingredients still makes it one delicious meal. They make a mean sandwich also! 

Service was relaxed but prompt, probably to keep up with the peak hour crowds. Definitely worth it if all you want is some straight forward Italian.",1
Quetzal,3,2018-12-22,"I had high expectations for this restaurant based on other reviews but for me, it ended up being just an average meal. 

The restaurant itself is very nice inside. The decor is unique and the feel of the restaurant is upscale yet welcoming. Staff are very friendly and professional. I don't particularly enjoy the high seats we had, but that's just me. The menu is a bit confusing so we had a lot of questions, and our server was happy to explain. There were four of us dining and we had intended on ordering our own food, but apparently this restaurant suggests more of a ""family style"" dining experience. I feel that this is a lazy way of serving, as you're basically told that they don't care about timing your food to come out together, so it's suggested you share whatever comes out first. Not my favourite way to eat when I'm dining with people I don't know very well.

One of the guys at our table wanted to order a drink that was under the ""Large Format"" heading, which our server explained was meant to share. She also said it could be served as a single drink if he wanted. I read the description (Velvet Krush) and decided I'd also like to try it. When our drinks were brought out, it was served as a single drink with two straws. I don't know what made her think that two people sitting on opposite ends of the table from each other would want to share a drink like that, but we sent it back requesting two separate glasses. Even if we had been a couple, I would not want to share a drink like that. Very strange. At least the drink was really good. Something I would definitely have again. 

We ordered a few ceviche dishes to start. Most of the dishes were good, but at this price point, I honestly expected to be wowed at least with some of the dishes. The presentation was exceptional, which is probably why I was disappointed, as I expected everything to taste as good as it looked. I did enjoy the scallop ceviche - probably my favourite dish of all the ones I tried. 

I had the hanger steak as my main with a side of grilled mushrooms. The steak was cooked rare, which I found to be a bit rubbery. Had it been cooked a bit more to mid-rare, it probably would have been perfect. Because they sliced the steak before bringing to the table, there's not much you can do to salvage it, aside from ordering a new one. Given the two-hour window they impose, I wasn't prepared to chance it, as we were over 2/3 of our time already. The mushrooms also looked better than they tasted, as I felt the broth kind of watered down the mushroom flavour rather than enhancing it. I also tasted the grilled fish and the coal roasted sweet potato, but neither was to my liking. It seemed like the char from the grill kind of overpowered everything else. 

At the end of the meal, there was nothing really outstanding for me. I'd return if I was with other people who wanted to try it, but can't say I'd rush back anytime soon.",1
Los Guaca-Moles,3,2017-04-29,"3.5. Actually. We were attempting to visit the Seven Lives Pop Up on Bloor, but the door was locked on Friday night at 7pm. We had seen the sandwich board for Los Guaca Moles on the street and decided that fate wanted us to visit this place instead. 

They were insanely busy during the dinner rush and we sat at the bar for a while waiting while the two staff who were running the bar and the floor got caught up. I have no problem with slow service as long as they keep the drinks coming. They were also apologetic and thanked us for our patience. 

We ordered the Guacamole with crickets which was a decent size and there was nothing wrong with the chips despite what other reviewers have said. The bartender brought us some nice habernero sauce that had a wonderful spice that sneaks up on you. The Pulpo Tostadas were bit too sweet for me. The octopus was tender, but the sauce ruined the flavour a bit for me. I aded more habernero sauce and they were better.

Tacos were loaded with fillings. The fish was dusted in cornmeal and cooked to soft perfection. Chorizo was interesting and quite good, but I""ll confess I only ordered it because they didn't have the liver taco available. The Lengua (tongue) taco was my favourite and reminded me of Mexico. 

There were also a few items going out that looked really delicious and unique to the restaurant. I'd love to go back and try out. 

Overall, I think Los Guaca Moles may be going through a few growing pains, but this leaves more room for them to grow! I'd go back and give them another go. The atmosphere was fun and intimate without being too crowded and I'd love to check out their cozy patio on a warmer night.",1
Como En Casa,2,2019-08-27,"I took the advice of one of the reviewers on Yelp & I got the hybrid burrito.  Boy was I disappointed.  I thought the flavours were sooo bland & the burrito itself was rice heavy & lacked sufficient amount of meat. Seriously I didn't even want to finish it.

Also it seemed like (from the pics on here) that this was a take out place, but it's not.  It's all table service.  

I just think this restaurant did not hold a candle to restaurants in the same price range.  In other words, it was ridiculously over-priced for what you get.  The burrito alone was around $15.",0
Artisan Plus,3,2019-09-03,"Artisan Plus received a great amount of hype upon opening on IG and I've been waiting to try it since.

AMBIANCE: 5/5
The store itself is small but functional. The seating is very well designed with ample room in between each table and each chair has it's own cubby to leave purses/shopping bags in. The decoration itself gives the restaurant a really nice modern, chic vibe and great for IG pics!

FOOD: 3/5
I ordered their famous YoPo Biang Biang Mian with Beef: this comes with scrambled eggs, tomatoes, carrots, zucchini, organic cloud ear mushroom, five spice tofu, edamame, and potato. The dish came with thick ribbon noodles which were THICK, chewy, and filling.
The plate was okay but a little underwhelming from how much hype was given. The sauce was a little plain and I was expecting more of a savory flavor. Because there was such a variety I believe they only put a little of each so it makes the dish seem insubstantial. 

SERVICE: 5/5
The service is really attentive here. The server was friendly and advised of spice levels of the dish (my friends CANNOT handle spicy). Water was always refilled and the food came out hot and fast. Bills came quickly and easily split.

OVERALL: 3/5
I feel like this was a solid but average experience. I'll be back in the future to try other things on the menu!",1
Ristorante Sotto Sotto,3,2019-05-06,"It's in yorkville and it has a cool name so it must be good, right? Right! Only, it doesn't get any better than good. Took my sis for her bday and was so shocked at how basic the flavours were. My mom got the four cheese spaghetti-- it was drippy n barely had taste. Mine was 7/10--a chicken dish, sister said her pasta was ""more wet than buttery"". The best part about this place was the beautiful interior and great service. I wish I liked the food more bcoz everyone seemed so nice.",1
Artisan Plus,4,2020-01-03,"A solid spot for hand-pulled noodles. I got the wok cumin che mian with beef. There's a lot of well-integrated flavour in the bowl. The noodles have the right texture. Precisely-julienned vegetables are all mixed in so there's a lot going on with each bite. It was labelled spicy but I didn't get a lot of heat.

It's pricey ($16 for what I got) and portions aren't massive, but it sure is tasty.",2
Enoteca Sociale,4,2019-04-25,"This may sound snobbish - but when I go to a new Italian spot, and I want to test to see if it is good, I will order the simplest thing on the menu. 

Pasta with a tomato based sauce. No major entree. Just an appitezer, and a pasta.

To start - we ordered a prosciutto, a raw cow cheese, a raw goat cheese. Initially thought it was a bit pricey, but the charcuterie board came with pickled peppers/cauliflower, green apple slices (sliced beautifully thin), roasted spicey pecans, and a small bowl of honey. It was very good. The raw goat cheese was my favorite. 

I ordered the Amatriciana - it was very simple, delicious and had a nice bite to it spice wise. I loved it.

We also ordered Cacio e Pepe - which I've never been a fan of because I was find this dish too salty. 

Overall - place was great. A bit pricy, but the food is delicious.",2
DaiLo,3,2019-11-23,"Very pricey very small portions but good atmosphere, services is pretentious but ok. Good place for drinks and what feels like tapas.  Good place for an expensive date, most plates enough for 2 ppl only. 

Plates to try: fried rice, whole fried fish, jelly slaw, 

Plates to skip: fried watermelon sound cool but just warm cubes of water lemon, ribeye (meat was tough), duck meat was also tough, 

We ordered 3/4 of their small menu. They don't have all the items pictures on yelp. 

They have an excellent bottle of white wine, Chasselas I think from France? Yum. 

BEWARE: we found that the prices they charged on our bill was different and higher than the prices listed on their menu ??!! Shady right??! How does that even happen?? Our bottle of wine was listed for $75 and they charged $85 and a few other other items too, $38 listed charged $40 etc.  We verified the wine and they admitted their fault.  We let the other smaller differences go but SHADY BUSINESS PRACTICE OR INCOMPETENCE?! 

Just REMEMBER TO CHECK AND DOUBLE CHECK YOUR BILL. ITS SO EXPENSIVE ALEADY so I guess most people just assumed it was accurate.",1

Fieramosca,2,2019-06-02,"Honestly, I don't know how this place averages 4.5 stars. My review would have been a 3.5 had it not been for the horrible service. 

My party made a reservation for about 12 people and we were given the room upstairs where other parties were dining as well. The layout and spacing in this restaurant are very tight so watch your step. The seating in the front doesn't quite make sense layout wise. When I walked up to the stairs me and an employee were basically dancing around each other to just get by each other...just why.

Our server the entire night honestly had an attitude problem. He basically had a stick up his ***. He was passive aggressive the minute we got there all the way to the end. He asked if we wanted appetizers and since we were waiting on a few people we asked for a couple of minutes. Unlike a regular waiter who would walk away and let you discuss he stood there hovering and just waiting for us to give him an answer before leaving. Even when he was putting dishes down he was just dropping them and tossing side plates here and there, it was completely unprofessional. It was time for pasta and while our waiter dished out the cheese another waiter helped with pepper. But the pepper waiter took a little longer than the cheese and you could hear our waiter yelling at the pepper waiter from the other room. Is this not supposed to be a classy environment? Why are you yelling at him in front of all the customers? 

Aside from the horrible service, the food was actually very good and the portions were huge! I ordered the Spaghetti Mare de Mario and the amount of seafood definitely did not disappoint! There were a ton of mussels but the spaghetti was not fully cooked. I had a chunk of it still stuck to each other and hard...

Overall I do not think this place deserves the rating it has based on this experience.",0
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,1,2020-05-24,"Ok, so I know this place is all the rage. 

I ordered the grilled beef for corona takeaway and I was disgusted. There was more fat, cartilage and inedible pieces than beef. Chew chew CRUNCH - spit. Over and over. My friend called me two hours later after ordering the same thing - she ended up giving her order to the homeless after the first bite. 

This means that they either don't clean (cut the meat) properly, or using cheaper pieces to save a buck. 

The grilled chicken was dry too. Honestly though, the shrimp was good. Stick to pulled beef and chicken for authenticity and - TEXTURE. C'mon seven lives!

Very disappointed.",0
El Charro,1,2019-12-29,"This place use to be good, but not anymore. The tacos tasted the same, hardly any chicken was found in my ""chicken burrito,"" and $11.95 + tax for a few SMALL pieces of calamari. I won't be returning.",0
Hotopia Downtown,2,2019-11-01,"Not for everyone, maybe an acquired taste. Had the Sichuan pickled basa as per other reviews and the flavours were just too strong. It would be nice to have a smaller portion version so new customers could try a wider spread and not feel so locked in. The single large $30 slightly tongue numbing, gingery sour soup was too much of a commitment for two people. Good initial taste but then it just becomes overwhelming. Definitely need a lot of rice for this dish.",0
Lai Wah Heen,2,2019-07-11,"First of all, let's be clear. Growing up in Asia, I have tasted the best of the best! So I'm not easily impressed by Chinese restaurants overseas. Lai Wah Heen came with rave reviews by Canadians, so I thought I'd check it out and see how it measured up to restaurants in Singapore and Hong Kong.

Verdict - Lai Wah Heen, which is supposedly 5-star here in Toronto, has dim sum that any 3-star restaurants in Singapore (eg. Mid-tier Wah Lok would win hands down) and Hong Kong can easily beat.

The presentation was nice. The taste profile of some of their offerings were decent, but there was only ONE stand-out dish that wowed - and that was the lava custard buns, which were flawlessly executed.

My biggest complaint was the skin on the steamed dumplings. The skin was too thick (especially the lobster dumpling) and chewing through it was laborious.

Overall, it's not worth the price.",0
Buca Yorkville,3,2020-02-16,"The entrance was a bit hard to find, since there was no door / entrance off of the main street (where the restaurant's address was). You need to go into the Four Seasons Hotel area, turn left, and it's the last door by the fence (it's right across from the side entrance of Four Seasons Hotel). There's no obvious sign indicating where the restaurant is, until you actually get to in front of the door.

The food tastes good, but nothing too special. Portion sizes of the pasta are a bit on the small side. The vegetable sides are quite good and rightly portioned. Service is attentive and just like in any other higher-class restaurants.",1
Eataly,3,2020-01-08,"Overall a cool place to visit. I had no idea what this place was, until I heard all they hype about it. When I received a gift card for it, I finally decided to check it out. We went on a Sunday afternoon and as expected it was busy. Assuming that there was line ups for the first week it was opened, it wasn't too bad. 

To start off, space itself was modern and vibrant. It was nicely decorated and had a little of everything. There was a supermarket, which kind of wrapped around the whole 2nd floor. From hand made pastas, sauce, cheese and etcs., they had it all. Surrounding the market was a few take out and, dine in restaurants as well, as cafe's and dessert. They also seemed to have classes too! 

The dine in restaurants were of course busy and, there was a wait so we opt'ed out for the take out joints. For the pizza, there was a variety of them but sold out quick (but also seemed like they were made quickly). There was also a take out joint, right when you go up the escalators which, seemed to have a variety of dishes. The gelato was one of my favorite things there and, maybe the best in the city so that's worth giving it a try. The desserts and chocolate, also looked amazing!

Overall, it was a cool experience and, would visit again to try the restaurants and dessert out!",1
House of Gourmet,2,2020-03-30,"Review is for take out. Normally when I order crispy chow mein, other restaurants will separate the sauce and the noodles. Not here, by the time I got home the noodles were all soggy  

The shrimp spring roll was such a disappointment with barely any shrimp, only one bite actually had shrimp in there. 

I ordered via Ritual so I thought the pick up would be simple. There is absolutely no physical distancing at all, the entrance was tight, people were crammed and confused, overall it was chaotic. Improvement needed.",0
Juicy Dumpling,5,2020-03-28,"Taste really good, authentic Chinese food restaurant.
Cheap and in a very good value.

Definitely have to try.",2
La Vecchia Ristorante,3,2019-07-18,"Going to start off this review by saying the food was great. Our table ordered the Caesar salad, gnocchi ragu, lobster pasta, and tagliolini con funghi. Wonderful food. 

Why the 3 stars? Boy, did we have the most annoyingly cocky/rude/ignorant waiter?! This customer service experience was so frustrating that it warranted a Yelp review. 
Upon entering the restaurant, everyone from the host to the bartenders had been amazing. We came on a busy night and we had no reservations, and the host had us seated at the bar while he scrambled to get us a table for 6. The bartender was great company, and we enjoyed our cocktails while waiting for a table. 
Of course once we were seated, we got stuck with this sarcastic douche bag of an employee... suddenly regretted choosing this restaurant just because of this dude. He made a lot of rude comments, maybe he thought he was funny? Somehow the conversation with him had eventually evolved into him reminiscing about getting 'so f**ked up one time' while our family was trying to enjoy our dinner. That was just the icing on the cake. 

The food did actually take a bit long to come out. We had waited a good half hour after ordering. 

If you can tolerate the company of some really rude and (not funny) sarcastic waiters, then I do recommend trying the food here. Otherwise, there are better places to spend $30-50 per person on dinner that will guarantee better service. Hopefully if you do go, you get a better server.",1
Itacate,1,2019-07-08,"I don't usually UPDATE a review; Friday was a disaster.
The owners should provide the staff/customers AIR CONDITIONING, they are sweating into the grill it's so hot (flavour to the tacos?).
The time it took to get 2 tacos was LONG.  Poor interior design, cluttered.  1 of 2 tacos went into the trash (very under cooked).  The tables are cluttered in garbage, food scraps.  They make enough money, pay a teenager to clean.  This place needs HELP.
It was one of those experiences where I'll try other spots on St Clair, over Itacate.",0

Bar Buca,3,2018-08-06,"Bar Buca was on my Bookmark list for brunch for a long time. Their egg skillet pictures impressed me. We didn't come sooner because my husband prefers a simple brunch menu which comes with eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, toast and salad. So, I had waited for a while until today.  

This afternoon I had trouble choosing which restaurant to have brunch at. We decided when it was 2 pm. Luckily, their brunch time is until 4 pm. So, we came to try out their eggs!  

FOOD (3.75/5)

- LA GRANDE COLAZIONE ($16). The dish comes with two hen's eggs, Italian sweet peppers salad (pepronata) and flatbread (tigella) . We saw the picture of the dish with FENNEL SAUSAGES on Yelp. It interested us and we both wanted to try it. However, I couldn't order the same dish as my husband did. I wanted to try something else also. I had a bite though (sigh). The sausage was small. It wasn't enough for two people lol. 

- UOVA CROCCANTI ($14). The dish came with three crispy duck eggs and topped with Buffalo Ricotta (cheese) and Pesto Genovese. The eggs and cheese were very flavourful. If you like cheese, you will love this. I'm not a big fan of buffalo ricotta. I like the taste but the smell was too strong for me. 

DRINK (4/5) 
We had Latte Macchiato ($3.95) and Americano ($2.90). Both were good. We love coffee. 

SERVICE (3/5)
I don't' really want o say that the service is mediocre. There are many reviews say that their services are great. Maybe it wasn't my day. My server was alright. She answered what I asked for but not really what I wanted. It was my first time and I wanted her to explain to us more about the menu and recommend us what the signature dishes are or what the most popular ones. We also don't know Italian! She said something. Short, and that was it! I could catch that those first few items on Salato section were salad and the half on the bottom were egg dishes, I guess. lol, I was disappointed! I was so excited at the beginning becuase I finally had a chance to come to try the brunch menu at Bar Buca. She just turned everything upside down. - -""

OVERALL (3.75/5)
The place was nice. The host was friendly. I love their eggs but I expect a bit more on their egg skillet and their service for the price. Would I come back again? I still want to try other dishes but I am concerned about their service.  We'll see!",1
Ristorante Sotto Sotto,3,2018-07-19,"Was here to celebrate my bestfriend's birthday. To start of with the service, I thought it was ok..we always had to ask for water refills. I didn't feel that the service was upscale enough for such a sophisticated, classy Italian restaurant.

Our server was knowledgeable and he made some recommendations. He suggested our party to order the Antipasto Gordonia ($24.95 pp) to share as we were all seafood lovers. I enjoyed the grilled calamari and tiger shrimps but everything else on that platter was mediocre. In terms of main, I ordered the Spaghetti Alla Carbonara ($22.95). The texture of the pasta was cooked to perfect al dente which I love. Flavour was rich but a bit too salty for my liking. My other friend who ordered a tomato based sauce mentioned her dish tasted like something she can make at home herself. Overall, food was just ok; nothing special. 

I probably won't come back as I feel that this one time experience is enough for me unless a friend of mine plan to host a party here in the future.",1
Eataly,3,2020-02-20,"I went on a Wednesday night around 8pm and was surprised there still many people, however, the wait for a table is not long.  Staff are all very friendly and very informative as I was asking about what wine to drink and etc.  The place is bright and clean but the only thing was I think (at least that's what I believe) there was only one washrooms to share for the entire Eataly.  
Food: the kale salad is a must!  It was so tasty!  The pasta was cooked to my liking (i asked a little cooked over al denta) and pizza was ok.  Overall I would come if there is no long wait.  And I still need to try their desserts!",1
Donatello Restaurant,3,2018-12-04,"Best crab ravioli & grilled calamari I've ever had! Friends ordered the veal marsala, a chicken special and fettuccine cream (don't remember the names) and they were flavourless. The restaurant is too cramped so it's hard to enjoy a meal without bumping elbows into the servers. Service however was really good. Would come back just for the ravioli & calamari.",1
Levetto,2,2019-12-02,"Went for dinner with five friends to celebrate my birthday. The food was excellent until the waiter offer me complimentary dessert. After ""happy birthday"", I dug in to the mini cake. That's when my friend noticed the mould. One of my friends discretely sent the dessert back to the kitchen. The waiter did not offer us a word of apology or a discount. I found that quite surprising and unprofessional. The whole situation left a bad taste in my mouth - not sure I would return.",0
Buca Yorkville,3,2019-11-03,"The food was good. But nothing amazing. We ordered the branzino it was good showed us the fished carved it table side. Great presentation.  Unfortunately it tasted like it was drowned in oil and lacked other flavours. We also ordered cured fish. Most of them tasted good some of them just tasted fishy.

The service wasn't bad. Over it was good had to try pretty hard to get our server a few times.  

Also they have a fruit fly problem inside.  Nov 2019. Half way through our meal we went from having one fly to 10. It wasn't pleasant.  The server were kind enough to move us to a different table and comp us 2 glasses of wine. But still wasn't what I would expect in this type of establishment.",1
Asian Legend,3,2017-10-28,"This was our first Chinatown experience and it left much to be desired. I'll start by saying that the menu is extensive, with over 160 items to choose from. Perhaps we didn't order the best dishes.

We ordered the soup dumplings with crab meat and pork, which were the highlight of the night. Both the Sui Mai and the chicken and cabbage potsticker, which were on special, did not hit home. They were both bland and could have used some salt. The last dish, stir fried Ho Fun with beef was good but the beef had an interesting texture, it had no chew and fell apart in your mouth. I'd say the noodles had good flavour but could have been better.

To sum up, the food was good. It wasn't great, it wasn't bad... it was good. The service was great. Food came quickly and servers were always nearby. If I do come back to this location, the soup dumplings are the only thing that I will be ordering again.",1
Ristorante Sotto Sotto,5,2018-10-12,"Great recommendation from Max at the Ritz Carlton.   We were celebrating my husband's 40th birthday.   We had the scampi appetizer, which came with three perfectly cooked scallops.  Husband order the carbonara and I had the angel hair pasta with shrimp,arugula, and tomato sauce.  We shared a 1/2 liter of Chianti ($45.00).  Total bill was 145 Canadian dollars.  Everything was perfectly seasoned and pasta al dente.  Restaurant is small, dimly lit and quaint and our server was very helpful.",2
Stelvio,1,2019-07-06,"The service is terrible and the food is not good enough to make up for the awful service. The one good thing on the menu is the risotto with the veal shank, but everything else we ordered was just okay. The waitress we had didn't listen well enough and took too long doing everything. We weren't even there on a particularly busy night, so the lack of good service can't be blamed on how packed the restaurant was. I would save the money and settle for somewhere else instead.",0

Mi Taco Taqueria,4,2020-03-02,"Mi Taco Taqueria is a vibrant take-out/sit-down taco joint on Queen West for Tacos and a small selection of alcohol. The tacos here are very reasonably priced, with most of them at $4, and some at $5 and $6. Ingredients were very fresh, tacos were garnished with a variety of toppings and the meat was seasoned well. I've been here a couple times and found the carnitas and carne asada very delicious but nothing exceptional. This time I got the shrimp taco ($5) which was topped with cilantro, pico de gallo, cabbage and grilled and raw onions. The shrimps were pretty small (probably size 31/35 or 36/40) but were very fresh and gave a nice crunch. 

Compared to joints like Wilbur and Campechano, I'd say what Mi Taco Taqueria lacks in their tacos, they make up in their price point. For a cheap but very good taco, Mi Taco is the way to go.",2

Mexico Lindo,5,2019-08-10,"Came here for pre-dinner drinks with a friend and I must say it's a COMPLETE GEM. I don't know why more people don't come to eat here, it's awesome. I pass by on my way to work every day but I never noticed it. 
We sat out on the patio and it was an extremely nice day. It let us talk and catch up since we haven't in a while. Our table was a little weird, every time I leaned on it it would roll because of the wheels on the bottom.
The service was amazing, but it was also not super busy at 5PM on a Friday - it started picking up around 7PM after we left. The server was very attentive to our needs, periodically checking in but not *too* often. 
The food/drink was unbelievable! I had a strawberry daiquiri and my friend had a piña colada. They use real coconuts and real strawberries (albeit they were frozen) and they tasted AMAZING, better than the ones I had in Mexico. We had some chips with guacamole and it was sooooooo fresh. They make their chips in house and you can really tell. Very comparable to one restaurant I went to in Mexico called Coco Cabana outside our resort in Cancun.",2
Lai Wah Heen,5,2017-08-01,"I'm surprised to read all these contrasting, love-or-hate reviews about Lai Wah Heen as I was fairly impressed with my experience here. And this is from someone who comes from a Cantonese background, grew up with dim sum flowing through my veins, and, as such, is very picky and demanding about it.

Yes, the setting in an otherwise aging hotel building (if the public areas are any indication) might not be the most inviting at first, but when you step inside, the first thing you notice is the clean, well-maintained venue that actually looks like a formal dining room - unlike the average unkempt dim sum house. Next, most of the staff appears to be native Cantonese speakers, which is always reassuring in terms of authenticity (although they do speak Mandarin, as many customers insisted). Perhaps, as someone who could speak Cantonese myself, I got friendlier and more engaging service than others would.

Although I got quite the sticker shock when I first reviewed the menu, I was also pleasantly surprised by how well-presented each item was. The lobster and shrimp dumpling, for example, came in the shape of a lobster, and had good chunks of seafood inside. The deep-fried prawn and scallop wrapped in bacon? Exactly as delicious as the description suggests. A steamed beancurd roll of mushrooms and truffle simply rose above typical dim sum fare. Meanwhile, the crispy fried pastry of foie gras and minced pork was also inviting in terms of its presentation - indeed, French-inspired - and also satisfying going down. Dim sum staples like the shrimp dumplings (har gow) and beef rice rolls (cheong fun) were also on point.

Furthermore, while it's all not going to be the best-tasting, best-value dim sum ever, nothing tasted bland or bad either. Just... decent. In another reassuring sign, I experienced none of the suffocating thirstiness afterwards that you'd get from lower-quality dim sum houses that douse their offerings with MSG or salt. Again, another check mark in terms of quality.

Given the effort they put into the presentation and the quality of the ingredients, I was quite satisfied with my visit here, even if it was quite expensive. Is this going to be a cheap, everyday dim sum experience? Absolutely not. But is this going to be a special treat that rises above the usual loud, busy, run-of-the-mill-quality dim sum hall? Absolutely yes.",2
Swatow Restaurant,5,2020-01-05,"Definitely one of my favourite places to go for some quick, cheap eats

I got the Shrimp wonton noodle soup for about $7.
Broth is not too greasy, tasty and came with 5 wontons and some veggies

Ambiance was just like any hole in the wall Chinese restaurant

Service was just like any other Chinese place, non-existent but understandable. You write down your order on a sheet of paper and after the waitress gives you a meal, they leave you alone. After they see you're almost done, they'll give you the bill with 2 fortune cookies. Just a heads up, they also only take cash.",2
Gusto 101,3,2020-01-18,"Coming here for the 3rd time because I was craving pizza. We got a seat right away around 7pm on Friday on the lower floor. Nice candlelit tables, dim, however very loud and we had to shout across the table to hear each other.

Went with the basic margarita pizza and fries. Despite my food coming fast, my pizza was cold :( Probably waited on the counter too long because my bf's pizza was warm. Thin and crunchy, I had a salt craving that day lol.

The fries tasted like layz fries (oily and crunchy) but airier. Comes with light garlic sauce.

Decided to try a panna cotta for dessert (blood orange for 10.99) I'm sad to say this is one of the worst desserts i've tasted, just wasn't my cup of tea. I thought it would be a custard consistency considering it's heavy cream based, but it came in a cup instead. And it wasn't creamy nor sweet- it was really sour! The orange froth on top was okay but then you get to orange chunks in the middle that's really tangy, and at the bottom you have olive oil?? My taste buds did not like the combination of olive oil and orange. Sorry, but i couldn't finished it :/",1
Ristorante Sotto Sotto,1,2018-11-06,"AVOID 
TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE
BETTER OPTIONS ELSEWHERE
-  was served 3 risottos when I asked for one, and was blamed by the staff that I ordered that many
-  risotto was raw as well

I was quite excited to try this place with two friends. The miscommunication ruined the whole experience for me. 

Knowing that the lunch stops at 3pm and that the risotto takes 40 mins to cook. I called in ahead of time to speak to someone around 1:30pm to have my amalfi risotto ready as I was making my way there. I spoke to a server, I informed her that I wanted 1 order of the Seafood risotto for a table of 3 people. I think it was this point where the miscommunication happened. She agreed and said it will be ready for us.

We arrived at 2pm, we spoke to the initial server and I asked him about the risotto, that I called in about. And he's like is it for here or to go? I told him that we were dining in. 

We were seated and waited for 40 mins. Before the risotto came out. To our surprise they brought us THREE RISOTTO dishes. Mind you, on the menu the risotto dish serves 2 people. At no point in time between 2pm to 2:40pm there was any clarification on the order. So I asked the server and informed him that I only wanted 1. So he fetched the server that I spoke to on the phone. And she insisted that I ordered 3 Risottos. I tried to explain to her that party was not ready to eat 6 peoples portion of risotto.

My experience is already ruined at this point. I don't know why she would think that I would want 6 people amounts of risotto. I could've tried other things in the restaurant. 

The risotto itself looked amazing. So if the food was okay I didn't mind.

Unfortunately the risotto was under-cooked. It had a grainy, sandy texture that stuck to the teeth. I informed my guests, and another one agreed with me. I let the server know, he brought Chef Massimo Renzi tableside and he just told me it was cooked al dente, and that he used carnaroli rice. 

So know we're stuck eating extra risotto that was under-cooked. My other friend thought the rice was fine, until he tried the one underneath the top layer. I'm assuming that the chef probably tasted that top layer and thought the other rice cooked as well. 

The seafood in the risotto was perfectly cooked but the dish was spoiled under-cooked rice. 

I think ultimately the experience was ruined when I got 3 Risottos instead of 1. Which caused the quality of control to go down on the rice. 

You will see in the photos that you can see the centre of the rice. Which is an indicator that the rice was raw.",0
Hong Kong Bistro Cafe,5,2017-06-21,"This place is awesome. The food is cheap, the food is good, the food is unique. Chinese style spaghetti? Yes please.

It's a bit hidden, you have to go up some narrow stairs to reach the restaurant. The decor is pretty plain but it's not disgusting inside like some other hole-in-the-walls.

I always get the baked spaghetti with seafood in white sauce here. The flavours are so good, the calamari in it is so crispy even when doused in the sauce. Come here with a few friends and try a bit of everything if you can. Or just come back as often as you can!",2
98 Aroma,1,2019-04-07,"If I was able to give 0 stars, I would. This is probably the worst restaurant I've eaten at. 

We ordered 5 dishes, 4 of which were completely inedible.
- Traditional pancake: This was our first dish and was fairly tasty. No complaints here. This was the only redeeming part of the experience.
- Green beans with minced meat: It was too salty and too oily. 
- Kungpow shrimp: This is absurdly greasy and spicy which left our tongues numb. 
- Fried rice with pineapple and seafood: In contrast to the previous two dishes that were over-spiced, this was tasteless and (surprise surprise) oily as heck. 
- Lobster with ginger and scallion: This was the most pathetic dish of them all. We were served either a baby lobster that had not yet developed any meat, or they somehow threw out half of the lobster before plating it. On top of this, it did not taste fresh.

Sometimes terrible food can be saved by good service. Nope, not today unfortunately. The waiters were amateur (pleasant, and well-meaning but did not know what they were doing). They gave us a dirty fork, and when we alerted them to it, they took it away then brought it back and said ""we washed it for you"". 

You might look at my profile picture and judge me for being a clueless white guy. I went with a group of 3 other Chinese people who know food well, and we were all appalled at how this restaurant is even open for business.",0
Stelvio,3,2019-05-25,"First time at Stelvio- wasn't as good as I'd hoped. 

We ordered some fritti mozzarella bites and they were good- but definitely needed a dipping sauce. Or maybe I'm just too used to real mozzeralla sticks with marinara. 
I wouldn't recommend it.

I ordered the pasta special which was a gnocchi with truffle, meat, and porcini. When I first got it I was happy that it came with a lot of truffle, but when I got into it I felt like it had too much. It was definitely too much of a good thing. But it was $28 so I guess they wanted you to feel like you got bang for your buck. 

My bf ordered the tagliatelle ragu and it looked good, but he said the primary flavour was salt. When I tried it- I would have to agree. It was tomato and salt. Not complex at all. 

Also as an aside- I would say the pasta portions are relatively small for the price. You get this dish with a little bowl dent in the middle and your pasta portion is basically the size of a rice bowl. 

I'm happy I tried it but I probably wouldn't come back.",1
La Carnita,3,2019-07-06,"2.5/5 stars. Delicious gourmet tacos, but pricey.

Food: 4/5. Everything I tried was delicious. We started with chips + 3 dips which I would highly recommend.  It came with tomato salsa, corn salsa and guacamole. I also really enjoyed the flavour of my tacos. I got:

- Achiote Chicken. My least favourite but still decent. 
- Crispy Cotija. Basically fried cheese, which you can never go wrong with. 
- Carnita. Pork taco with amazing fixings. This was my absolute favourite. 

We also got a pitcher of one of their daily special drinks, which was a pineapple beer. The glass came rimmed with HEAPS of salt which everyone at my table hated - salt & beer? 


Service & Atmosphere: 2.5/5. Loud & dark space. Hipster in style. Server was nice but visited our table very rarely. There were 5 of us at the table being billed separately. All of our bills were out of order. I had a taco missing from my bill, which got added on to someone else's bill, etc. When we tried to say something to the server she just handed us the debit machine. We ended up figuring out her billing mistakes ourselves and paid each other back the appropriate amounts. 


Value for Money: 2/5. This is where it really falls flat for me. Each MINI taco is about $6.00 each. They can be finished in 2 bites. That's ~$3.00 per bite. They are mini tacos too so you'll need a few of them to feel satisfied.",1
Trattoria Nervosa,5,2019-10-22,"I was on the hunt for good Italian food in Yorkville that wasn't ridiculously overpriced. Upon recommendation and the great online reviews, a girlfriend and I decided to go with Nervosa, and I'm sooo happy we did. 

The food was amazing! I went with the Calamarata Con Gamberi dish which was to die for. It included ""wild shrimp, tomato sauce, cherry tomato, chillies, marjoram and parsley."" It was spicy but had just the right amount without overdoing it. My friend went with the Mafalde Al Funghi which is one of the pasta dishes that Nervosa is well known for. This dish included ""portobello, porcini, crimini, oyster mushrooms, parmigiano, truffle paste and light cream sauce."" I also got a bite of hers and despite hating mushroom, it was delicious. We also got the Bruschetta Al Funghi, which again included mushrooms but was nonetheless tasty. I've actually never had bruschetta prepared with mushrooms replaced by tomatoes, but I'd order it again. 

To drink we got the Must Be Nice & Diablo cocktails, both of which were so good. None overly sweet which is usually my number one issue with cocktails. 

The service was superb! All the waiters that served us were friendly and attentive. Our food took probably a bit over 10 minutes to come which was great, considering the restaurant was packed and it was a Saturday night. Even the wait to be seated initially went by fast. 

I will hands down be back! I absolutely loved it here!",2
Asian Legend,3,2019-11-23,"Since living in LA and having a chance to go to Din Tai Fung whenever I wanted, it makes it really hard to think anywhere else could be better. This place was authentic and tastes like bistro dim sum. We got the soup dumplings, shrimp steamed dumplings, and scallion beef rolls.",1
MEXITACO,2,2019-07-22,"This was the worst $32 I ever spent ... 
soggy & flavourless. Was very excited to try this place but I don't think I will be returning or ordering again in the future. Disappointed :(",0
Magical Taste of China,2,2020-01-27,"I came here with a group of friends and I have to say I wasn't very impressed.

It took us a long time to even get enough menus that we could share. The menus are confusing as there is a large place-mat like sheet you can use, or the menu book with pictures.

Then they tried to sell us a membership. Really? A membership? When I looked at the menu again there are 2 different prices. The cheaper one is the membership price and is of course brighter and more prominent than the higher non-member price. 

We ordered a variety of items and they were all meh. A few items we had to ask for again as they were forgotten. 

The staff run around yelling at each other and its really annoying and disturbing. 

When we finished and tried to pay, the waiter tried to split our bill and half way through asking each of us what we ordered he gave up and gave it to another server, so we had to start over again.

I wouldn't go again unless I went with someone with one of these fancy memberships.",0
Bamboo Kitchen,2,2014-01-12,"Good take-out place with well-priced specials each day for the price of $4.99 before tax.  Went here on a whim and ordered the Sunday specials of eggplant tofu on rice and BBQ chicken leg.  You get what you pay for.  Greasy more than flavourful.  It is delicious in comforting way.  The hot and sour soup was plenty hot but not sour enough.  Service was brisk and abrupt.  Seems to be frequented by students and there's a bit of a language barrier.

Not particularly motivated to try it again in the future no matter what the price point could be.",0
Dumpling House Restaurant,3,2019-09-01,"CASH only. There's a bunch of banks/ATMS around the area so you're good just in case. Service is less to be desired but the dumplings were pretty solid. If it's your first time, I recommend trying 3 different flavours first for $12-13 (additional $2) instead of committing 12 dumplings to one flavour. They've got steamed and pan-fried. We really like the pork and shrimp - the only juicy and flavourful dumpling. The classic pork and chive were quite dry and the spinach needed salt to save its integrity. Tried their beef noodles and was super garlicky and the noodles were broken up which was annoying to eat.

Overall, will I be back, probably not - considering there are so many other dumpling spots in the area that will probably have better dumplings and better service.",1
Chula Taberna Mexicana,3,2020-01-31,"I forgot, the second time I went, how bad the green curry is and got it again.  Damn it.",1
La Vecchia Ristorante,1,2017-02-04,"I live in the Yonge/ Egg area and always heard this was supposed to be the best place on Yonge for food as the neighbourhood is quite lacking in the food area to begin with. 

I had high hopes for this restaurant but was gravely disappointed with the service and the food. The flavours they have are all wrong. Most of the food was very pungent and did not have a smooth flow of flavours. It was rather sour the risotto we ordered. We also ordered prawns and the sauces they chose were sour and pungent with too much salt. ( it's all in the sauce for Italian dishes). 

The Gnocchi was okay, it tasted like the Costco brand in a cream sauce ( who could mess up a cream sauce tbh) anyhow I am very disappointed. I did not find the food appetizing at all. The flavours were all mixed up and not great on the palette. 

My waiter unfortunately was very short tempered and seemed agitated the whole time whilst serving my family and I. Whenever we did need something he was never available and would rush off before we finished speaking with him. 

Anyway sad to have to review it like this but that is truly my opinion. 

No match to Campagnolo on Dundas or Buca",0
Hotopia Downtown,4,2020-02-02,"Authentic Sichuan style restaurant in Downtown Toronto. The spicy level is more inclined to salty flavour instead of pure spicy one. In this case, it is more acceptable for most of customers. The two dishes we ordered are all pretty good. Personally I prefer the dry pot vegetables dish and all different type of vegetables melts in the dry hot pot in great harmony. Some tips: save your time if you join in the yelp waitlist before your arrival. It can at least save you 15-min waiting time.",2
Tacos El Asador,2,2019-02-26,"Cash only.. it's 2019 
Plates with holes in it.. it's 2019
Food is decent, but get the basics right",0
Stelvio,3,2018-09-26,"This small restaurant isn't a place I would have chosen myself but was suggested to me by a local Torontonian. Stelvio has a location in Toronto as well as in Milan, so my expectations were set really high. The service was great but honestly the food didn't meet my expectations. 
Being a vegetarian my options were limited, so I went with the mushroom risotto. By the time it got to my table it was cold, likely because of the way they plate it; a thin layer of risotto in a large bowl, almost looks like a porridge. 
My colleagues went with the prosciutto and beef wrapped around a thick wooden dowel, which came with polenta fries and looked rather unique, they seemed to enjoy it. 
Wines are all on the pricey side... amarone starts at $185...
All in all I was expecting more.",1
Asian Legend,4,2019-08-30,"For some reason you expect good Chinese food to only be served at ugly restaurants. But not this place. It's modern, clean and still serves rather incredible food. Dim sum, seafood, large dishes etc. The only down side to this place is that they have a limited dim sum menu and there are no old ladies to push the food around in carts.  Everything on the menu is super delicious. They have large party rooms and can easily seat groups of 8-10 in their main area as well. Highly recommend.",2
Playa Cabana,3,2018-09-07,"My friend and I decided on Mexican food for dinner and this popped up as nearby where we were at the time, Yorkville/Annex area. As we walked in, immediately we're greeted and seated in a tight space for 2. The menu was explained to us and water was given, then we were left for a few minutes to decide. 

We decided on salsa fresca & chips, chicken enchiladas suizas and short rib emmoladas along with a bottle each of corona and negra cervezas.

Salsa fresca and chips arrived first, the tomato salsa was delicious, the morita chile seemed to have been grilled before it was mashed together with tomatoes and red onions and went well with the crispy chips. (If you come for anything at all, this would be it and definitely skip the guac as it didn't seem appetizing.)

My friend and I shared the chicken enchiladas suizas and short rib emmoladas, while tasty, I could've gotten it somewhere else for cheaper. 

Because of how tight the space is, I was able to look around at what the other dinners ordered and the the tacos seemed to be more popular, so will have to come back and try those.

We also ordered alfajores, which at $8 for 2 was just meh.",1
Taverna Mercatto,3,2019-11-15,"This is go to for us before a game. The food is consistently good. Service is also good with a good offering. Considering the area, it's good value for the money. Atmosphere is quite lively. Pizza is very good ... wood fired. Friendly casual environment. Good place to visit even if you're not attending a game.",1
El Charro,2,2019-05-26,"Located just across the street from the Broadview TTC station the place is hard to miss. A no frill joint with simple Mexican decor. Based on the reviews ordered the 3 for10$ tacos : Asada, steak and chorizo... I had a lot of hope , but crash landed my expectations with dry and not so fresh tacos. Honestly not at all up to the mark. Wife ordered a tostada with tinga de pollo ( chicken) and was equally disappointed with the serving size and taste. We definitely need to go back to Seven Lives to reset our experience.",0
El Trompo Taco Bar,5,2020-01-04,"We went here on a pretty, hot and sunny day so we opted to get seated outside. This cute Mexican cuisine place is so adorable. Their prices for food are fair and come in nice portions, their customer service is also very excellent, our server was so sweet.

The nachos were very good! The salsa was very flavourful and tasted really bright, totally recommend",2
DaiLo,2,2019-09-06,"2.5 stars. Nice casual ambiance. The tasting menu is around $190 for two, after tax and tip. I was let down by the food. They have a tendency of using very strong flavours that were overwhelming and competing with each other.

For instance, the pea dumpling had black truffle, bone marrow, and bacon. I wish I could have tasted the pea filling and bone marrow more because that was quite delicious, but it was overpowered by the more dominant flavours.

The wontons in sweet chili sauce was my least favourite dish. It was way too sweet (desensitized my tasting buds for the next dish), and the wonton wrappers mushy and falling apart.

The tacos were doused in aioli and it made the whole thing just taste like spicy mayo.

The fresh leaf wrap was very good and texturally interesting.

I didn't think the tofu ""cheese"" Caprese salad was anything special, but the tomatos were nicely peeled to soak in the dashi.

The smoked duck is a smart menu item because it can be prepared ahead of time and has a longer shelf life, can be served cold (well it was served cold to us so I assume that's intentional). The downside is that the fat is not rendered at all. and cold duck fat can be very rubbery. The skin was also unpleasant. It was not similar to a duck prosciutto where the fat is tasty and thinly sliced. The purple potato mash was very boring.

The ""famous fried rice"" tasted purely of black truffle oil, so if you like truffle you'll enjoy this. Thankfully there were no other competing flavous. I didn't think it was special. I think dousing things in truffle oil is a bit of a copout.

Our server was very nice, but he was quite busy. We had to wait a long time for water sometimes, and the sparking water cups are so tiny that I was constantly running out. No  pitcher or bottle for the table. Time between dishes is also long.

Overall I don't regret coming here, but I'm not sure if I'd come back. The value for the quality of food was not worth it for me. It certainly was interesting to try once.",0
